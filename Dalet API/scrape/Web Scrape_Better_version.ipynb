That\\'s what I said,\" the teacher said in the video.The student, caught off-guard, said he no longer felt the same about the educator.\"Kind of made me mad because, like I had respect for him, but I don\\'t really respect him (anymore) because, like, why would you just say that to kids?\" Luellen said.Others in the class said that this wasn\\'t the teacher\\'s first time displaying racist behavior.Following the remarks, the school district fired the teacher.\"And why is it \\'cause I\\'m a white guy I can\\'t say that?\" The now-former Klein ISD teacher can be heard asking that question during the conversation that the district has since apologized.', 'time_date': Timestamp('2022-11-16 00:00:00')}]\n",
