      "{'headline': 'Chicago Public Schools cancels classes after union backs remote learning', 'time_text': 'Wednesday, January 5, 2022', 'body_text': 'CHICAGO -- Leaders of Chicago Public Schools canceled classes Wednesday after the teachers union voted to switch to remote learning due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, the latest development in an escalating battle over pandemic safety protocols in the nation\\'s third-largest school district.\\n\\nChicago has rejected a districtwide return to remote instruction, saying it was disastrous for children\\'s learning and mental health. But the union argued the district\\'s safety protocols are lacking and both teachers and students are vulnerable.\\n\\nThe Chicago Teachers Union\\'s action, approved by 73% of members, called for remote instruction until \"cases substantially subside\" or union leaders approve an agreement for safety protocols with the district. Union members were instructed to try and log into teaching systems Wednesday, even though the district said there would be no instruction and didn\\'t distribute devices to students ahead of the union votes, which were announced just before 11 p.m. Tuesday.\\n\\n\"This decision was made with a heavy heart and a singular focus on student and community safety,\" the union said in a statement.\\n\\nHowever, district officials blamed the union for the late cancellation, saying despite safety measures, including a high teacher vaccination rate, \"our teachers are not willing to report to work.\"\\n\\n\"We are deeply concerned about this decision but even more concerned about its impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our students and families,\" the district said in a statement.\\n\\nThe status of instruction for the rest of the week remained in limbo, while district leaders said a plan to \"continue student learning\" would come later Wednesday. School officials deemed the union action a \"work stoppage\" and said those who did not report to schools Wednesday would not be compensated. Last year during a similar debate, the district punished teachers who did not come to schools.\\n\\nContentious issues in the roughly 350,000-student district include metrics that would trigger school closures. The district proposed guidelines for individual school closures, saying safety measures like required masks, availability of vaccines and improved ventilation make schools among the safest places for kids to be. But the union has proposed metrics for districtwide closure, citing risks to students and teachers.\\n\\nStudents returned to class Monday after a two-week winter break with COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations fueled by the omicron variant at record levels. School districts nationwide have grappled with the same issue, with most opting to stay open.\\n\\nWhile the union has characterized their action as a way to get better safety protocols in schools, district leaders called it an \"illegal work stoppage.\" A fierce battle took place last January over similar issues causing a bumpy start to the district\\'s return to in-person instruction after first going remote in March 2020.\\n\\nSchools CEO Pedro Martinez said buildings would remain open for administrators, staff and \"essential services,\" but not instruction for students in the district that is largely low income and Black and Latino. District officials said schools would offer food service from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and COVID-19 testing would continue as scheduled, but afterschool activities would be canceled. The district also provided a list of city sites with available daycare.\\n\\nIn response to union concerns, the district said it has provided 200,000 KN95 masks to teachers, would allow schools to bring back daily health screening questions for students and building visitors that were required last academic year, and would spell out metrics for closing individual schools. For instance, the district said it would switch to remote learning at an elementary school if 50% of its classrooms had more than 50% of its students instructed to isolate or quarantine.\\n\\nThe union, with roughly 25,000 members, had sought the same metrics to close schools from an agreement last year, which expired before the new school year started. That includes a districtwide two-week pause on in-person learning if the citywide COVID-19 test positivity rate increases for seven consecutive days, for instance.\\n\\nUnion leaders said more safety protocols were needed and that the COVID-19 surge was causing staffing shortages. The district said roughly 82% of its roughly 21,600 teachers reported to work Monday, which was lower than usual, but that classes were covered by substitute teachers and other staff.\\n\\nDistrict officials said student attendance for the week was not yet available.\\n\\nRoughly 100,000 students and 91% of its more than 47,000 staff in the district are vaccinated, according to the district.\\nReport a correction or typo', 'time_date': datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 5, 0, 0)}\n",

During this time, interest has stopped adding up and collections on defaulted debt have been on hold.\\n\\nMORE: US Department of Education overhauls Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\\nEMBED <>MORE VIDEOS\\nThe US Department of Education announced major changes Wednesday to a federal student loan forgiveness program.\\n\\n\\nBoth Biden and former President Donald Trump took actions to extend the pause. Most recently, Biden moved the payment restart date from September 30, 2021, to January 31, 2022, but the administration made clear at the time that this would be the final extension.\\n\\nSome Democrats urge Biden to extend relief\\n\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, both of Massachusetts, have been pressuring Biden to extend the student loan repayment pause.\\n\\n\"The pause on federal student loan payments, interest, and collections has improved borrowers\\' economic security, allowing them to invest in their families, save for emergencies, and pay down other debt,\" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the President last week.\\n\\nBefore the pause, borrowers were paying an average of $393 a month for their federal student loans, according to an analysis from the Roosevelt Institute, which was provided to Schumer and Warren at their request. That means that collectively, borrowers will be paying roughly $7 billion a month, or about $85 billion a year, once the payments resume.\\n\\nSchumer, Warren and Pressley are also continuing to urge Biden to take further action and cancel up to $50,000 of student loan debt per borrower.\\n\\nBiden said during the presidential campaign that he would support canceling $10,000 per borrower, but has not taken action to do so beyond directing federal agencies to conduct reviews on whether he has the authority.\\n\\nHe has repeatedly resisted pressure to cancel up to $50,000 per borrower since taking office -- making it very clear during a CNN town hall early in the year that he does not support the idea.\\n\\nSeparately, since taking office, Biden\\'s Department of Education has made it easier for people who were defrauded by for-profit colleges to seek debt relief. It has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that cancels outstanding debt for qualifying public service workers after they have made payments for 10 years.\\n\\nPreparing for payments to resume\\n\\n\\nMost borrowers with federal student loans have not had to make any payments since March 2020. Direct Loans as well as PLUS loans, which are available to graduate school students and parents on behalf of their children, are eligible for the benefit. Some federal loans that are guaranteed by the government but not technically held by it, known as Federal Family Education Loans, or FFEL, did not qualify. Generally, those were disbursed prior to 2010.\\n\\nThe relief is even more significant for those who work in the public sector and may be eligible for federal student loan forgiveness after 10 years. They are still receiving credit toward those 10 years of required payments as if they had continued to make them during the pandemic, as long as they are still working full time for qualifying employers.\\n\\nBorrowers will receive a billing statement or other notice at least 21 days before their payment is due, according to the Department of Education. Those who had set up auto payments may need to notify their loan servicing company they want those to continue.\\n\\nIf federal student loan borrowers can no longer afford their monthly payment, they may be eligible for an income-driven repayment plan. Under those plans, which are based on income and family size, a monthly payment can be as low as $0 a month.

If a student fails a test or doesn\\'t complete their homework, they\\'ll be able to retake the test and get more time to turn in assignments. The idea is to encourage students to learn the course material and not be derailed by a low grade that could potentially disqualify them from admission to the University of California and California State University. Students who don\\'t learn the material, pass the final exam or finish homework by the end of the semester would earn an \"incomplete.\"\\n\\n\"Our hope is that students begin to see school as a place of learning, where they can take risks and learn from mistakes, instead of a place of compliance,\" said Nidya Baez, assistant principal at Fremont High in Oakland Unified. \"Right now, we have a system where we give a million points for a million pieces of paper that students turn in, without much attention to what they\\'re actually learning.\"\\n\\nRELATED: Chronic absences spike at Oakland school as students struggle to stay motivated during distance learning\\n\\nAlthough education reform advocates have been pushing for this for years, the pandemic offered an opportunity for districts to put it into action. With so many students languishing academically after a year of distance learning, districts see dropping D\\'s and F\\'s as a way to help students who had been most impacted by the pandemic, especially Black, Latino and low-income students.\\n\\nBut the move is also, potentially, a step toward an entirely different learning system, in which students are assessed by what they\\'ve learned, not how well they perform on tests on a given day or whether they turn in their homework on time. Known as competency -- or mastery-based learning -- the style has been a staple of some private and charter schools for years, and a goal for education reformers trying to overhaul the traditional high school system.\\n\\nWhile traditional grading may have worked for previous generations, a competency-based system is better suited for the rapidly changing workplace of the future, said Devin Vodicka, former superintendent of Vista Unified in San Diego County and chief executive of the Learner-Centered Collaborative, a nonprofit that helps districts shift to competency-based learning.\\n\\n\"We need a system that gets beyond the institutional model and provides more meaningful feedback for students,\" Vodicka said. \"The future is going to require less focus on time and more focus on what we can do and contribute, and the quality of our performance. We need to prepare our students for this.\"\\n\\nRELATED: Oakland High School students, parents struggle with online classes, crowded study areas at home as new school year starts\\n\\nAt most high schools, grades are linked to time; a grade reflects how well a student has performed on tests and homework by the end of a semester. Grades can open doors to advanced classes and are the primary component of college admissions, especially since universities like UC and CSU temporarily dropped standardized tests as part of the admissions criteria.\\n\\nBut they\\'re notoriously subjective. The state Education Code gives teachers the authority to issue grades, but it doesn\\'t specify how those grades should be determined. Some teachers grade on a curve, with only a set number of students earning A\\'s or B\\'s, while others are more lax. An informal EdSource survey of about two dozen California teachers found that 57 percent rarely or never gave D.s and F\\'s. Only 7 percent said they did frequently.\\n\\n\"Grades are punitive and provide no information on standards mastery,\" one teacher wrote. \"I would love (grading) to be based on mastery of standards and ... authentic feedback.\"\\n\\nBut for some teachers, Ds and Fs play an important role in the classroom. They signal that a student did not learn the material and needs extra help. Dropping Ds and Fs doesn\\'t guarantee that students will learn the material, even with extra help, and may lead to grade inflation, said Debora Rinehart, a math and science teacher at St. Theresa School, a Catholic school in Oakland.\\n\\n\"I will work with any student before or after school or even on the weekend to help them learn. However, I will never lie about their knowledge level,\" she said. \"Not reporting Ds and Fs is the equivalent of lying about a student\\'s progress.\"\\n\\nBut the vast difference in teachers\\' grading styles has resulted in a system where grades are nearly useless as an indicator of students\\' abilities, said Alix Gallagher, director of strategic partnerships at Policy Analysis for California Education.\\n\\n\"What does a grade mean? It\\'s a mix of things, and it\\'s different from teacher to teacher. It can actually be radically different,\" she said. \"As it\\'s practiced now, grading is idiosyncratic, and that\\'s not a good thing.\"\\n\\nToo often, she said, grades take on outsized importance for students, and those who get Ds or Fs become discouraged or disengage even further, never learning the material they missed to begin with.\\n\\n\"Instruction is what leads to learning. Not grading. They\\'re separate. That\\'s the problem -- we have a disconnect between instruction, learning and grading,\" she said.\\n\\nPatricia Russell runs the Mastery Transcript Consortium, a nonprofit that advises school districts and colleges on alternatives to grades. Interest in the topic has been soaring, she said. In the three years since the group started, membership has increased from four districts to more than two dozen nationwide.\\n\\nFor college applications, Russell\\'s group encourages students to submit a portfolio that includes essays, tests with high scores, videos showing oral presentations, lab projects or other items that showcase a student\\'s best work.\\n\\nThe idea is to show colleges evidence of what a student can actually do, not a teacher\\'s interpretation based on a limited grading scale.\\n\\n\"We\\'re talking about people who are very young, and labeling them at such an early age as \\'less than\\' or \\'more than\\' can have significant psychological repercussions,\" Russell said. \"Some things in life are zero-sum games, but learning should not be.\"\\n\\nTwo large school improvement networks, supported by foundations, have made re-examining grading policies a priority.\\n\\nLaura Schwalm, a retired superintendent of Garden Grove Unified who is now chief of staff of California Education Partners, said the aim is a grading system that puts students on track for admission to the UC and CSU, as well as trade schools.\\n\\n\"Graduating with a D, in career and technology courses, too, leaves students with few choices,\" she said. \"No one is saying water down grades. This is about giving support, not lowering standards, and looking for simple ways to make grading more fair, to give kids a fighting chance and to measure what students know with multiple opportunities to show that.\"\\n\\nLynn Rocha-Salazar, a former principal in Fresno Unified who is now CORE Districts\\' senior improvement coach, said the work on grading preceded Covid, but the pandemic underscored the need for it.\\n\\nRELATED: High school freshmen struggle to find friends and connect with a school they haven\\'t visited\\n\\n\"Those who had not been well served were penalized the most. ... So now is a time to examine grading practices to see the harm that was done,\" she said.\\n\\nLindsay Unified, in rural Tulare County, has been moving toward a competency-based system for several years, and results are promising. Students at Lindsay High School, nearly all of whom are low-income and Latino, scored higher than the state average among all student groups on math and English language arts tests, as well as in college and career readiness, according to the 2019 California School Dashboard.\\n\\nIn Oakland, high schools are moving gradually toward a new system of assessment that doesn\\'t include D\\'s and F\\'s. Baez, assistant principal at Fremont High, said the change will not happen overnight. Parents, students and especially teachers need time to understand what\\'s expected of them, and they must \"buy in\" to the change, she said.\\n\\n\"It has to be a cultural shift at the school.

He takes clippings from the tops of the oldest and largest, some 400 feet tall, back to his lab in Copemish, Michigan.

The $1.5 billion project comes with a major catch - 94% of the dorm\\'s single occupancy rooms are in the interior of the building, and have no windows.\\n\\nA consulting architect on the university\\'s Design Review Committee quit in protest of the project, in a resignation letter obtained by CNN Business and reported by the Santa Barbara Independent.\\n\\n\"The basic concept of Munger Hall as a place for students to live is unsupportable from my perspective as an architect, a parent and a human being,\" California architect Dennis McFadden wrote in the letter. McFadden declined further comment to CNN Business.\\n\\nUCSB\\'s campus is located on cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean and has its own beach. Its beachfront location is an integral part of campus culture and identity - and Munger Hall doesn\\'t reflect this, McFadden claimed.\\n\\nWhile the dorm rooms themselves don\\'t have windows, the exterior of the building does, which lets natural light into the communal living spaces.\\n\\n\"Even the rooftop courtyard... looks inward and may as well be on the ground in the desert as on the eleventh floor on the coast of California,\" McFadden wrote.\\n\\nIn addition to being Warren Buffett\\'s right-hand man, Munger is an amateur architect. He has no formal education in the field.\\n\\n\"Architecture is a field where tastes vary, and everyone thinks he\\'s an expert. And no two architects ever agree on anything,\" Munger told CNN Business.\\n\\nMunger, the 97-year-old vice chairman of Warren Buffet\\'s Berkshire Hathaway, donated $200 million to UCSB to fund the dorms, with the caveat that his designs are followed. He wanted the dorm rooms to be tiny and windowless to encourage residents to spend more time outside in the common areas, meeting other students.\\n\\n\"While the bedroom may be \\'just good enough,\\' the entirety of the experience makes it exceptional -- \\'our town in the sky,\\'\" the October UCSB design review committee report said.\\n\\nThat didn\\'t sit right with McFadden.\\n\\n\"As the \\'vision\\' of the single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the University serves,\" McFadden wrote.\\n\\nThe plan for Munger Hall includes an 11-story building that would provide more than 4,500 beds for undergraduates. Each residential floor would have eight \"houses,\" each holding 63 students. There are eight suites in each house, and every suite has eight single-occupancy beds - window not included -- as well two bathrooms and a common space.\\n\\nThe rooms do have artificial windows, however, which Munger said resemble the Disney cruise ship\\'s artificial portholes where \"starfish come in and wink at your children,\" the Santa Barbara Independent reported.\\n\\nUCSB said in a statement that the project and design of the building will go forward as planned. The university added that all its current housing projects are guided by a campus plan, which was \"developed through an extensive campus participatory process with the assistance of Urban Design Associates.\"\\n\\n\"When this thing goes up and becomes an extreme success, which is absolutely inevitable, I think there will end up to be more buildings like it on the UCSB campus,\" Munger said.\\n\\nMcFadden wrote in the letter that the population density of Munger Hall would be slightly lower than a portion of Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated cities in the world. There are only two points of entry and exit.\\n\\n\"The project is essentially the student life portion of a mid-sized university campus in a box,\" McFadden wrote. \"Munger Hall is an experiment in size and density with no precedent in student housing at that scale.\"\\n\\nThe plan was designed by architect Navy Banvard, a principal at Van Tilburg, Banvard, & Soderbergh. Banvard said Munger Hall is a collaborative process between UCSB, Munger and the design team.\\n\\nUCSB, like other universities, is facing a housing crisis. The Daily Nexus reported in August that UCSB ran out of spaces in university housing and had a waitlist of over 1,000 students who were searching for a place to live.\\n\\n\"One of the reasons, and there are many, for the project is to address the University\\'s substantive housing needs,\" Banvard said. \"Good and affordable housing for students in a very competitive housing market.\"\\n\\nMunger\\'s grandson is an alumnus of UCSB.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a product of education, public education,\" Munger said. \"And I know how important schools are and the architecture of schools is, so naturally I drifted toward giving dormitories.\"\\n\\nThe project would be slated to open in fall 2025 pending approval and certification in 2022 by the California Coastal Commission.\\n\\nThis is not Munger\\'s first venture into dorm architecture. Munger Graduate Residences at the University of Michigan follows a similar concept. The high-density dorm, which also has mostly windowless bedrooms, was funded by a $110 million gift by Munger.\\nReport a correction or typo', 'time_date': datetime.datetime(2021, 10, 30, 0, 0)}\n",

By September 18, 2021, the number was nearly slashed in half, down to 4,738 licensed substitutes.

Many teachers resigned or left the profession last year so there were a lot of openings and many of our substitute educators have been hired into full-time jobs and so the pool that we have left of substitute educators is significantly smaller than it typically is,\" Thiel added.\\n\\nThirdly, while some substitute teachers prior to the pandemic had recently finished their teaching programs, last year those programs likely didn\\'t see the same amount of people going into teaching, Thiel said, thinning the pool of substitutes who would typically be available even further.\\n\\nAnd it comes as more teachers are now having to call out sick. Some, for symptoms with which, before COVID-19, they could usually go to work, like a cough or a runny nose. Others, to take care of their own children, who may have been exposed to the virus or are required to quarantine.\\n\\n\"Those factors have increased the number of absences but at the same time, we have fewer substitutes to fill those absences,\" Thiel said.\\n\\nIn their statement, Rosilez and Bare called the temporarily new rule a \"short-term solution\" which will allow districts to keep functioning \"in the face of unprecedented staffing shortages while we tackle the continuing problem of teacher shortage across the state and country.\"\\n\\n\"The Commission will more fully review this temporary rule and feedback from school districts at its November meeting,\" their statement added.\\n\\nThiel also highlighted the rule is only a short-term fix, and added much larger system-level changes are needed to support schools and their staff.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not just substitutes that we don\\'t have enough of.
