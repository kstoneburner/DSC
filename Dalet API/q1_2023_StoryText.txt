First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
This is a live look at P-G-and-E's power outage map for the Bay Area.
It's not nearly as busy as it was last night but there still are quite a few people without their electricity.
Most of the outages are along the Peninsula and the South Bay.
In the South Bay the heavy rain caused more flooding... swamping roads and major highways including 101.
This had drivers looking for creative ways to get around the closures.
ABC7 news reporter Lauren Martinez spoke to some of them as they dealt with the delays.
South Lake Tahoe faced severe flooding and structure collapses.
Yesterday's atmospheric river brought heavy rainfall to the Basin.
At least seven structures collapsed due to the mix of snow and rainfall.
Several businesses were seen taped up from the storm impacts.
Officials deemed the properties unsafe to occupy, closing down numerous operations.
Tourist Vicki Herbert described what a mess the storm made.

 
The Basin has shoveled out 500 inches of snowpack so far this season.
City officials urge people against traveling to Tahoe over the next several weeks. 
The Santa Cruz Mountains were hammered by last night's atmospheric river. 
County crews are working to restore access to hundreds of residents. 
Soquel's Main Street at Bates Creek caved in... isolating more than 450 homes.
It happened when a six foot culvert underneath the road got washed out by the rain. 


Residents were finally able to get across to the other side of the collapse by foot,  thanks to neighbors whose property leads to a small private foot bridge.
County officials expect to be able to get temporary vehicle access to those residents by tomorrow. 
The road is just one on the county's long list of repairs to be made after devastating weather since January. 
In the East Bay ..  Niles Canyon Road remains closed between Pleasanton and Fremont..
Today, we found vehicles being forced to turn around at Mission Boulevard because of the closure.
Alternate routes are Interstate 680 to North Mission Boulevard or Interstate 580 to Highway 238.
Yosemite National Park is closed through Thursday March 16... possibly longer.
A Yosemite spokesman says a partial re opening on March 17 is the best case scenario.
Record snowfall has buried much of the park, which has been closed for almost two weeks. 
Park crews are continuing snow removal operations.
Today, State water officials opened the main spillway at Oroville Dam for the first time in four years to manage flood risks.
The state's second largest reservoir is now 75 percent full.
Water levels have risen 180 feet since December First.
The spillway had to be rebuilt after it collapsed in 20-17's flooding crisis which forced more than 180-thousand people to evacuate.
Officials say today's release was "relatively small" at about 15-thousand cubic feet per second.

Fire officials said there was already five-feet of snow in the county before the rainfall. 
Water is also being released from the Folsom Dam.
Folsom Lake is the main flood control system for the Sacramento area.
It still has plenty of room for storage but officials decided to start releasing water because of the latest storms.
The storm did significant damage in Tulare County as well.
Raging flood waters washed away roads on the Tule River Reservation.
There are multiple evacuation orders and warnings tonight in the county due to flooding.

We'll talk with a Stanford University Finance and Economics Professor about what this means for the markets and for its customers.
But first ... the atmospheric river has passed through the Bay Area.. but more rain is on the way.
Here's ABC7 Meteorologist Lisa Argen with the latest Accuweather forecast.
In the biggest financial bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis and the second largest bank failure in U-S history.
Regulators today shut down and took over Silicon Valley Bank, the nation's 16th largest bank, and one of the biggest institutions serving Silicon Valley tech companies and investors.
These are some stunned customers outside the Palo Alto branch.
Joining us live now to help us understand what's going on and what this means... Stanford Finance and Economics Professor, Anat Admati. Professor Admati, thanks for being with us. 
**This complicated for those who aren't econ or finance majors... for the laymen, how did this collapse begin? what triggered it?
**what is the significance of Silicon Valley Bank and its place in the banking world?
**how big is it? how much assets? who does it serve? what kind of products did it specialize in?
*did the bank need to do raise money? If it didn't do that, would things have actually been fine?
**did SVB do something wrong, in the way it made investments or otherwise, or could this happen to any bank?
**what's happened to the SVB's stock?
**So what now? Now that the federal government is involved... what happens?
** At the end of last year, SVB estimated that the amount of uninsured deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits was around 151-billion dollars. Meaning potentially 151 billion dollars is uninsured by the federal government. Is that money gone now? 
**what are the ripple effects on the tech industry?
**are there other banks that may be in danger?
**are there systemic issues or laws that need changing to prevent this from continuing to happen?
Rivers overflowing.
Roads damaged.
Trees down.
And a long way to go on the cleanup.

Conditions are expected to be treacherous.
People heading to the region are being asked to come prepared... or re-think their plans altogether.

 
There are two main concerns with this next storm.
Rain makes snow incredibly heavy - which could cause roof collapses.
Also, snow covering storm drains could lead to flooding.
PG&E has diverted crews to areas that are expected to get hit hard by this storm.
They expect there will be power outages and downed power lines.
A spokesperson has this advice for Bay Area residents.


Another reminder is to have ice ready or even a cooler prepared in the event of a prolonged outage.
That's to help keep food from the refrigerator from going bad.
A programming note.

For the details, let's go to ABC7 news weather anchor, Spencer Christian.
As expected, the atmospheric river hammered Santa Cruz County...and now hundreds of homes in the community of Soquel are cut off after a road collapsed.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes is live in Santa Cruz County and has a look at the damage and how the community there is coming together... Zach?
County officials tells us that the impacts of the atmospheric river were not as brutal as they were prepared for...but that's compared to January's devastating storms.
There are still impacts here in this county including more than 400 homes that can only have access to the rest of their town and resources by foot ....and that is only because of the generosity of some kind neighbors.
The County says they expected to be able to get tempoorary vehicle access to those residents by tomorrow.
Right now they say they are hopeful that the presidents disaster declaration for the state of California will bring them some added resources to be able to fix problems brought on by these back-to-back storms.

A Silicon Valley shocker. 
This morning, federal regulators seized the assets of Santa Clara based "Silicon Valley bank"....making it the second largest bank failure in U-S history.
Many customers went to local branches desperate to learn about what will happen to their money.
But as ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains... they left with more questions than answers.
Many customers went to local SVB branches desperate to learn about what will happen to their money.
But as ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains... they left with more questions than answers.
A gray cloud hangs overhead of the Silicon Valley Bank branch in Menlo Park.
Customers... venture capitalists... start-up owners... trying to learn the fate of their money after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized all assets following the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.
Many came by the bank today to find out what to do.
The lights were on... but no one from SVB was home... only representatives from the FDIC pointing customers to a press release detailing what comes next.
The release explains that the bank will reopen on Monday... at which point customers can get back their money up to 250 thousand dollars.
250 k is insured by the FDIC... customers with more in SVB will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.
We met one of those customers.
The overall mood of people today was calm... but an underlying fear hangs over everyone.
The reality is anyone or startup with more than the insured 250 thousand may... or may not get that money back.
According to SEC filings...that's roughly 95% of money deposited into SVB or more than 150-billion dollars.
So for now... all these people can do is wait.
In Menlo Park Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
Investigators are trying to figure out if the storm was responsible for a deadly roof collapse at a Oakland warehouse this morning.
A male employee was killed after the roof at Peet's Coffee distribution center collapsed just after 3A-M.
Another employee inside the warehouse was also hurt
The collapse happened 15 minutes after the worker arrived to work.
70 other employees were scheduled to start work within the hour.

Hello, I'm Julian Glover.
And I'm Kristen Sze.
LET'S GET RIGHT OVER TO METEOROLOGIST DREW TUMA FOR THE TIMELINE. 
This morning, President Biden attempted to reasure Americans that the U.S. government is working to contain the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
The President's remarks came as the government promised customers their money would be available once branches opened today.
ABC7 News reporter Amanda del Castillo is live outside bank headquarters in Santa Clara -- where customers have been lining up all morning.
It seems things are changing by the hour--
Word from a fairly new Silicon Valley Bank customer who arrived at this Santa Clara branch at 2 this morning.
Before doors opened after 9  a-m, a line of about a dozen people had already formed--
Of course, all with more questions than answers.
"This is an active institution...."
Once branches open to customers, they'll have access to all their funds--
A promise made by the F-D-I-C earlier today, in response to the collapse of both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.
This relief comes as President Biden addressed the nation during the 6 am hour--
Assuring depositors, they will be protected. 
The F-D-I-C was on-hand at this S-V-B branch in Santa Clara--
Where Ben Sand - founder and C-E-O of Australia based Strong Compute - describes his uncertainty.
Only having banked with S-V-B recently, Sand says access to the account for his *A-I for medical imaging* company hadn't been fully set up...
Reasons why he showed up at 2 a-m with questions ready.
The F-D-I-C says depositors will have that full access through bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bank, N.A.--
It'll open and resume normal banking hours, and activities, including online banking.
It's designed to essentially *bridge the gap between the failure of a bank and the time when stability and resolution could be made by the F-D-I-C.
Have some patience.....
The president, committing to holding those responsible for the collapse, accountable.
Saying, he's continuing efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks.
The president, insisting this is *not a bail out.
Funds will come from an F-D-I-C account...
Different from the taxpayer-funded bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis.
In Santa Clara, Amanda  del Castillo,  ABC7 News.

County officials say that's all coming from the drastic levee breach along the  Pajaro River.
This morning, an urgent search is underway in Mexico -- for three women who crossed the border from Texas.
 They were traveling about three hours south into Mexico to sell clothes at a flea market.
They left February 24th and have not been in contact with family members since shortly after they left.
The husband of one of them contacted authorities reported them missing after not hearing from them in several days.


The FBI says it's aware of the disappearances.
This case is gaining attention after that other kidnapping case -- just across the border from  El  Paso, Texas.
Four people were taken -- two were killed.
Authorities say it was a case of mistaken identity by a local drug cartel.
Five people were arrested in that case -- and charged with aggravated kidnapping and homicide.
New developments.
The ABC station in  El  Paso, Texas says a bridge connecting Texas to Mexico has reopened to both vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
The " Paso Del  Norte International Bridge" was closed yesterday -- after officials say a large group of people formed on the side of the bridge in Mexico... trying to enter the United States.

Authorities from Mexico worked to disperse the group.
Customs and Border Patrol says physical barriers were used to keep the crowd from crossing.

Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto says most of the rescues have been in the town of Pajaro.  
 "I can tell you at least close to 800 homes have been impacted by this flood. This is about as bad as you can get and the water is still rising.  
And that fast-rising water catching some residents off guard . . . Juan capturing this video as he was rescued from his home . . . he says some of his neighbors don't want to evacuate. 
 "More than anything, if you're not getting out be safe. Because the water is rising a lot."

The sheriff . . . . asking people to take the order seriously. 
 "But with these orders that's going to be more people that we have asking people to evacuate out of their homes. These are the low lying areas, we're looking at the 100 year floodplains so it's a lot of people."

Santa Rosa's Montgomery High School is beefing up security, putting an officer on campus today and tomorrow.
It comes in the wake of a *second concerning incident this month.

That was *before police even heard about it from school administrators.
The 15- and 17-year-old students were arrested the next day.
That comes just a few weeks after 16-year-old Jayden Pienta was stabbed and killed in class during a fight.
Today, the school district announced Mongtomery High School's principal and assistant principal have been placed on administrative leave through the end of the school year.
The rain has been steady for a few hours in parts of the North Bay.
And some neighborhoods can barely take anymore of it.
ABC7 News Reporter J-R Stone continues our live team coverage in Santa Rosa.
J-R how is it there?
You could probably call this the calm before the storm. 
I don't even know if you'd want to call it a drizzle, somewhat of a sprinkle so far here in Santa Rosa. 
It has been coming down like this for much of the evening. Not a hard downpour, steady and slow rain at times. 
The concern though are many of these hillsides.
We were on Cooper Drive Monday and you can see the hill is covered with tarps because that hillside is sliding. It's already caused this fence to buckle. 
Two homes have been redtagged. 
There are now concerns that the hill will keep moving with another couple inches of rain.
We spoke with those who were out and about Monday night. 
Everyone well aware of the weather situation. 

 
Hector who you heard from there says he's probably lost between three and four thousand dollars because he is unable to do construction work. 
That being said I talked with a cookie delivery driver and he said business is up 20 percent as people are opting to stay indoors.

Good Evening, I'm Ama Daetz.
And I'm Dan Ashley.
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.


An entire town evacuated because of massive flooding from this weekend's burst levee.
And it comes as another atmospheric river takes aim at the Bay Area. 
Good Evening, I'm Ama Daetz.
And I'm Julian Glover.
Tonight we are on storm watch.. as we get ready for that next round of rain.
WE have ABC7 news team covearge.. from the flooding in monterey county.. to mudslide concerns in sonoma county.
But let's begin with ABC7 news meteorologist Sandhya Patel for the details of the rain.. 
Flooding has devastated parts of Monterey County....
A levee break in the community of Pajaro ""pah-her-oh"" has forced the evacuation of nearly two thousand.
Some of them may not be able to return home for weeks.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes is live in Pajaro ""pah-her-oh"" with a look at the devastation.
We have seen incredibly tragic images out of Monterey County but especially right here in Pajaro.
Waters may not receded until the levee break can be reconstructed...officials say crews are working 24/7 to make that happen.
But right now, many who live here are at evacuation centers, just trying to figure out what happens next.
It's been a heartbreaking weekend for the residents of Pajaro in Monterey County.
The levee breach Friday, put the town underwater...
People like Andres Garcia and his family were left with nowhere to go but county evacuation centers.
 we got evacuated around 130 in the morning. So we had like, a few minutes, like maybe 30 minutes. So we grabbed just the necessary things. blankets are a little bit clothes. And just left and came here.
Garcia is one of around 17 hundred people displaced from their homes....virtually the entire town...but residents are telling us that they have neighbors who stayed in the evacuation zones.
 we don't really have clothes and we would stay in a motel. But then at the same time, my neighbor's there. He's like 80 something years old, has no water, trying to get water to him. They won't even let us take them water.
The Monterey County Sheriff's Office says that with current conditions, they can't let people back home.
Officials tell us that this most recent atmospheric river has brought more impacts throughout Monterey County than the one in January
 this was a tremendous amount of rain, a direct hit this atmospheric river that was full, full, full of moisture, and it just, you know, Monterey County was in its path, and it was in its direct path.
County Supervisor Luis Alejo's district includes Pajaro.
 Most are low income Latino farmworkers, many immigrants. And this is the worst thing that could have happened to them at this time. These are residents who have the least. And so this being evacuated and the damage to their homes and their vehicles and their businesses is going to be severe, and the pain is going to be prolonged for many weeks, and months.
Alejo is calling on Governor Gavin Newsom and President Joe Biden to bring in more federal resources to Monterey County.
He says what happens to this community made up of mostly farmworkers and ag land, will have large-scale impacts.
 This should have been the beginning of the harvest season. Now this is going to have an impact on our food supply. Beyond that the impact to jobs is going to be enormous. It's going to be severe because these farm workers are not going to be out of work for a very long period of time. 
A period of time many of those workers say is agonizing.
 we're probably gonna return maybe like in three weeks. So we don't know yet. It depends on the weather.
Right now the county says the state has crews working around the clock to stabilize the levee breach...they're hoping to have that done by the end of today once that happens water will stop flowing through the town here.
Right now the main concern and focus continues to be this next atmospheric river and how these already inundated communities will be albe to handle that.
Live in Monterey County, Zach Fuentes ABC7 news.
Now to the latest on the abrupt collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
President Biden announced today that his administration is stepping in to ensure customers of the banks retrieve  their money.  
ABc7 News anchor Liz Kreutz is in the newsroom  with how it will work and what the bigger impact of all of this is. Liz?  
President Biden insisted today that taxpayers will not be the ones bailing out these banks. He laid out his plan, while also assuring americans that the financial system is stable and that people should not be worried about their own deposits. But, of course, the sudden collapse of these banks has raised a lot of concerns and questions.  
President Biden is in San Diego this evening-- the first stop of a three day West Coast swing.
This afternoon, Mr. Biden held a trilateral meeting with the Prime Ministers of Australia and the United Kingdom.
The three discussed an 18-month-old nuclear partnership, that enables Australia to access nuclear-powered submarines.

ABC7 News meteorologist Sandhya Patel is tracking the rain in real-time with live doppler 7 radar.
We start with her... and the accuweather forecast.
Sandhya.
In the North Bay...It's going to be an anxious night for several Santa Rosa residents.
There's the reason.
The rain has caused this hill to become saturated and to start sliding.
It has already destroyed the fence of one house.
Two properties on Cooper Drive have been red-tagged and several more are being threatened.
Residents fear the new storm could make this situation catastrophic.
Now to the impact... companies and people left in financial limbo.
Many returned to the bank today to get their money.
ABC7 News reporter Dustin Dorsey spoke with some of them... and tell us the situation left some companies on the brink of a funding collapse.
 ABC7 news Reporter Dustin Dorsey visited the  Menlo Park branch Friday and was back today where he found that there was a much different experience.
What a difference a weekend makes.
When we were here Friday... the mood of Silicon Valley Bank customers in  Menlo Park was concern and fear that they may lose their businesses after the bank failure.
For some today... relief.
Others... still worried after seeing the flaw in the system this situation highlighted.
The line to get funds back was long and slow moving... some people arrived before the branch even opened at 9  a.m.
It took about an hour and a half to get through.
FDIC employees answered questions along the way before the customers could enter the doors for the first time since last week.
Patience easier said than done when you're talking about millions of dollars in some cases... like with  Otter.ai co-founder and CEO Sam  Liang.
He could only imagine how this could've gone for his company and others had the government not stepped in.
Now mostly in the clear... the focus turns to what's next.
Customers said this will change how they bank... and they're all wishing for what's best for one other.
In  Menlo Park Dustin Dorsey  ABC7 News.
To the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank... and concerns about a ripple effect throughout our economy. 
Here's a quick timeline.
Federal regulators closed the Silicon Valley Bank on Friday after the bank ran out of money... due in part to a huge loss in its bond portfolio and depositors rushing to withdraw their funds all at once.
The Treasury yesterday said it would not bail out the bank...
but would use 25-billion dollars to offset any deposits customers lost.
Today, President Joe Biden insisted the nation's banking system is safe.
We're going to delve a little deeper into this issue.
ABC7 News anchor Liz Kreutz learned that all banks will have pay for SVB's failure.
She's live tonight in the newsroom to break it down for us.
Liz?

  The Bay Area taking body blows from the weather.
       And with more storms coming-- very little time to clean up from the last round.
         But, despite a battering, there is reslience everywhere you look.
Good Evening,  I'm Dan Ashley.
and I'm Ama Daetz.
Tonight - the big story remains the tens of *thousands of families and business that are without power across the Bay Area.
 The latest update from PG&E shows about 68- thousand customers in the dark... you see here most in the South Bay and Peninsula.
Tuesday's storm is historic in this sense...


Now when it comes to getting the power *back -- that's going to be very difficult for some.
ABC7 News Reporter Lauren Martinez is in downtown Los Altos where we hear it may be *days... Lauren?
Fortunately we have Sandhya safely protected out there on the roof.
But it's getting just a little cold out there?

First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
It's expected to take several days to replace those high-rise windows that were blown out by the wind in downtown San Francisco yesterday.
Repair crews are waiting for strong gusts to die down before starting the work. 
Shards of glass fell from two windows on the 43rd floor of 5-5-5 California Street... which is currently unoccupied.
It's completely dark here in downtown Los Altos.
Earlier this afternoon it was desolate, hardly anyone walking around on such a nice day.
PG&E is projecting power will be restored at different times, some alerts project tomorrow night, Friday or even during the weekend.  
The Chamber of Commerce is also hosting this community bbq.
The free event is from 3-6 tomorrow afternoon at the Chamber parking lot.
They will also be collecting donations for flood victims of Monterey County.  
this bag tells the story of just how windy it was yesterday.
check it out -- that suitcase is rolling along a runway at s-f-o.. and rolling.. and rolling.
there were a lot of delays across most all public transit systems in the Bay Area -- even a brief ground stop at s-f-o because of the weather.
The other clear signs of disaster we saw from this storm were the countless number of trees that came toppling down.
All across the Bay Area.
One of the most stunning instances was this tree -- falling on part of a church in Pleasanton. 
Tonight -- the church held one of its sermons. 
But the problem with these downed trees continues to stir debate around the city. 
ABC7 News Reporter Anser Hassan has more.  
BART was one of those -- slammed with serious delays from the intense winds.
Tonight BART's board president was at a packed event in San Francisco... speaking to other issues that plague the system -- and blaming the City of San Francisco for safety issues on board.
ABC7 News Reporter  J.R. Stone has tonight's look at the state of BART - one of our key focuses in Building a Better Bay Area.
In  Woodside... Highway 84 is closed due to a massive sinkhole in the roadway.
Caltrans says lanes in both directions between Portola road and Skyline boulevard are shut down indefinitely.

San Jose's new mayor, Matt Mahan, is vowing to get back to financial basics.
His latest budget proposal calls for investments in community safety, cleaning up neighborhoods and finding housing for the unsheltered population in his city.


Mahan's plan would have room to add 30 police officers... build 500 extra units of emergency housing... money for trash and river cleanups... as well as extra city planning needs.
The nation's 10th largest city -- San Jose -- is looking at a projected 30 million dollar surplus in the next fiscal year.
Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao is implementing a hiring freeze in certain departments, in an effort to close a 350 million dollar budget deficit.
Oakland is looking to avoid future layoffs.
The Chronicle reports the freeze will include hiring within The Mayor's own department... as well as Oakland's violent crime prevention unit.
It will not affect the police, fire, planning and building, housing or transportation departments. 
It's unclear how much money the hiring freeze is expected to save over the next two years. 
The storm might still give you a bit of trouble, depending on where you're driving tomorrow.
Highway 9 in the Santa Cruz Mountains is shut down due to this large landslide blocking the road.
This is near Holiday Lane in Ben Lomond.
One home was seen at the edge of the slide, just feet away from being swept down.

Caltrans says crews made major progress, but this could take a while to repair.
Now to your voice and your vote... 
U-S Congresswoman Barbara Lee of the East Bay held a campaign event in Walnut Creek today.
Lee spoke to the Rossmoor Democratic club and met with members of the community there.
This was Lee's second campaign event for U-S Senate since announcing her bid for current Senator Dianne Feinstein's seat.
Lee recently told ABC7 News that her campaign focuses on the climate crisis and public safety.
If Lee wins, she will be the only Black woman to currently serve in the Senate.

 Are you a fan of HBO's "The Last of Us"?
If so, you surely know about the parasitic fungus "cordyceps" - which turn people into zombies.
But you might be surprised to know you can buy them in San Francisco's Chinatown!
And the price will leave you with sticker shock.
But first ... the latest atmospheric river to slam the Bay Area is moving out.
You may even see some sunshine where you live.
But there are looming threats -- including, right now, a dangerous situation in San Francisco.
We've just learned a shelter-in-place has been ordered because glass is falling from the Bank of America building at 555 California, near Pine.
This is a live picture.
It's a little hard to see, but we have a crew on the way, and will bring you updates as we get them.
In Marin County, one driver braved going under a tree that fell across Sir Francis Drake Boulevard.
This is near Lagunitas.
This car made it through, but the road was closed shortly after.
In Monterey County, more than 2-thousand people are still out of their homes after the levee breach along the Pajaro ""PAH'-ha-row"" River.
Crews are working 24/7 to reconstruct the levee and stop the flooding.
And in the Sierra, high winds and avalanche dangers have kept Palisades Tahoe closed today.
This is video from the top of the gondola.
There's also a risk of flooding in the next 24 hours.
And the wind and rain around the Bay Area have caused many power outages.
This is the current PG&E outage map, showing just how widespread those outages are.
The orange squares are 500 to five-thousand customers.
The red triangles are areas where *more than five-thousand customers are impacted.
ABC7 News meteorologist Lisa Argen is tracking the latest on this storm and what conditions will be like as we head into the evening commute.
Lisa?
As we showed you at the top of the show, power outages are a big problem right now.
Joining us live now is Tamar Sarkissian, PG&E spokesperson.
**So altogether, how many customers are experiencing outages right now?
**causes? damage to power lines and trees?
**you got enough crews out there?
**How long is it taking you right now to get customers back up?
**how long people expect to be in the dark?
**Safety tips for people?
I'm Kristen Sze.
You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today as the Bay Area works to remove the many many trees downed by yesterday's storm... calls are getting louder for one particular type of tree to be removed... one that's posing a great risk to cars, trains, houses and people.
Also... what if you had an Etsy but for locally prepared food? That's what a new Bay Area-based platform aims to be... enabling home shefs to earn an income using their talents. We'll meet the folks behind shef, with an S, dot-com.
But first... the Federal Aviation Administration today held a safety summit after a rash of near collisions at airports across the country.
The latest incident was yesterday... when a Republic Airways flight crossed the wrong runway at Reagan National after a United flight had been cleared to take off from that same runway.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg led the summit and promised to address safety issues.
Joining us live to talk more about what needs to be done is ABC News aviation expert and a former pilot, John Nance.
**There have been 7 close calls this year, and we're only in March... this is not normal, is it?
**Why are all these runway near misses happening? Who's at fault? Air traffic control? Pilots?
**sounds like it's not one thing? Sec. Buttigieg said today it's like "a kind of rust"... that's not reassuring
**So what needs to change, in your assessment?
**Is oversight lacking? At what level? Is the FAA itself the problem?
**Are control towers operating with severe staffing shortages?
**Is it an issue with pilot training? Some of these incidents... like the one at JFK airport in January involving a Delta and an American flight... those are legacy carriers flying major routes... you'd think the pilots are very experienced...
**Is cockpit automation an issue?
**Is air traffic control technology outdated?
**The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board said today her agency has made seven recommendations on runway collisions that have not been enacted... what are they? one is technology warning pilots of an impending collision. why haven't they been adopted?
**but other ideas or actionable next steps came out of today's summit?
**is it safe to fly right now?
Joining us live now is ...

State and local agencies continue to work together to coordinate flood preparedness and response across the state.
State officials are offering additional resources to marginalized communities as more storms move in.
The website " Listos "" LEE- STOSE"" California-dot-org" has resources in multiple languages to prepare emergency kits and plan for possible evacuation.
  People with disabilities are encouraged to find people who can help them during a blackout.

 
Other tips to be ready for evacuation include keeping cellphones charged and keeping a  ziploc bag with all important documents and medications at the ready.

Crews completed the first phase of emergency repairs to the levee last night.
Newsom says government and private support is on the way to those impacted -- but a long term fix for the levee is still years away.

Governor Newsom is pledging state support for the Monterey county community of  Pajaro, after touring the devastation caused by the levee breach.
Crews completed the first phase of emergency repairs to the levee Tuesday night.
Newsom says government and private support is on the way to those impacted, but a long term fix for the levee is still years away.


The state actually approved nearly 140 million dollars in funding to repair the levee last year.
The fix is long overdue.
There have been at least five major breaches since the levee was constructed in 1949.
Dramatic moments as first  responders rescue a man trapped in fast moving waters in the Los Angeles River. 
Video shows the 51-year-old holding on to the wall-- barely keeping him from being swept away.

Oakland Mayor  Sheng  Thao is implementing a hiring freeze in certain departments, in an effort to close a 350 million dollar budget deficit.
Oakland is looking to avoid future layoffs.
The Chronicle reports the freeze will include hiring within The Mayor's own department, as well as Oakland's violent crime prevention unit.
It will not affect the police, fire, planning and building, housing or transportation departments. 
It's unclear how much money the hiring freeze is expected to save over the next two years.
A proposal to spend 25-million dollars on police overtime in San Francisco was given the  greenlight yesterday, according to the Chronicle. 
The push, backed by Mayor London Breed, aims to help the police department maintain staffing levels as it struggles to fill vacant positions. 
Critics argue it condones excessive overtime for officers. 
Next week, the Board of Supervisors will discuss the spending, which would be on top of the department's 714-million dollar budget. 
San Jose's new mayor, Matt  Mahan, is vowing to get back to financial basics.
His latest budget proposal calls for investments in community safety, cleaning up neighborhoods and finding housing for the  unsheltered population in his city.


Mahan's plan would have room to add 30 police officers, build 500 extra units of emergency housing, money for trash and river cleanups, as well as extra city planning needs.
San Jose is looking at a projected 30 million dollar surplus in the next fiscal year.

The parents of 23-year-old Finnegan Elder of San Francisco.. and 22-year-old Gabriel Natale Hjorth ""nuh-TAL-ay yort"".. filed into the "Court of Cassation" this morning, but the ruling came just before midnight in Rome.

His amended proposal would give the California Energy Commission the option to place a cap on profits.

We paid very high prices at the pump last year.
And big oil saw record profits during that time.
Gas prices are starting to drop from their recent surge, but prices are still around five dollars in many parts of the bay area.
Triple-a says the most expensive gas is in napa county.. at 5-10 per gallon.

You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today... US stock futures tumbled as worries about a bank crisis grew... is human psychology responsible for the panic? And if so, can a rival of the U.S. cause a collapse here through social media manipulation?
We'll talk with a leading expert of behavioral economics.
Also... fans of cooking shows, listen up. A feast for eyes and tastebuds is being served up today... and it's all to benefit a Bay Area college program that's turning out great chefs through an affordable education.
But first... the math doesn't add up. 
that's what a lawsuit just filed this afternoon against the San Francisco Unified School District claims about the district's controversial policy to ban algebra class for 8th graders... a policy that the state of California may be recommending for all public school students.


The lawsuit's plaintiffs are the co-authors of a recent op-ed in the San Francisco Examiner, which says the district's delay of Algebra 1 til high school has created a nightmare of workarounds that are most hurtful to kids from lower income families.
Joining us now... Rex Ridgeway, the grandfather of a Lincoln High School sophomore and a board member of the Parent Teacher Student Association there. And David Margulies, a material scientist who's co-authored 34 patents.
Thanks for joining us.
**Your lawsuit was just filed this afternoon... here's the cover... what is your claim?
**in 2014, the school district said no more to algebra until 9th grade.... the stated goal was equity... lowering the number of underrepresented minority and low income students from failing algebra 1 in 8th grade, and to eventually get them into higher level math. The district says it has reduced the number of students failing courses... isn't that success?
**why should people who don't live in San Francisco care about this battle?
**a recent shift in thinking in math education on the state level is away from the race to the top, with the top being defined as calculus... and toward no one being left off the "advanced track" early on, layering on concepts each year, and having different branches that have to lead to calculus. so why is taking algebra in 8th grade important?
**what are your workarounds for your granddaughter Joselyn, the Lincoln High school sophomore? 
**you say, and the lawsuit says, the district's claims of success were overstated or misrepresented... give us one piece of evidence that backs up your allegation?
**you say the district labeled a math course as "advanced" that really isn't in the eyes of top colleges... what are you referring to?
**why do you say delaying algebra availability is actually worse for equity?
**SF Unified was not only school district to remove algebra education in middle school... Palo Alto did the same... wasn't there a recent court decision there?
**Do you have supporters on the board?
We reached out to the school district for comment... but the suit has just been filed.. and we have yet to get a response.

 " I believe that's his right to express his beliefs and views how he wants to if he's not being aggressive or angry about it not wearing a jersey shouldn't be that big of deal. 
But Ford says not putting on the Pride-themed jersey sends a dangerous message. 
 "We have suffered under the yolk of people thinking and acting like that . . . and I'm not going to stand for it. I'll meet him wherever he wants to talk about it."

The future of prison life in California is being transformed.
And Governor Gavin Newsom says it all starts with the infamous San Quentin Prison.
It was once home to the worst criminals in the state, but will soon be a lower security facility -- focused on rehabilitation, education and training.


Governor Newsom laid out the plan yesterday.
ABC7 News reporter Cornell Barnard has the details.
While some people are praising the plan, others are upset by the idea of turning San Quentin State Prison into a Rehabilitation Center. 
Marc Klaas - founder of the Klaas kids foundation - says the plan will not work for violent offenders.


Klaas' 12-year-old daughter, Polly, was kidnapped and murdered by Richard Allen Davis.
He says Davis was formally released into society from a rehabilitation center ... and killed his daughter a few months later. 
ABC7 News Insider Phil Matier gave insight into some of the potential political concerns. 


Crime victim advocates say the governor never reached out to them.
They say his plan is best suited for low crime offenders.
We want to show you the history of San Quentin -- the oldest prison in California.
Construction began in 1852 ... prisoners worked on building it and slept on a nearby prison ship until it was complete in 1854.
Both male and female prisoners were incarcerated there until 1933.
It has housed the state's only gas chamber and death row since 1938 ... although the last execution there was in 2006 and the gas chamber has not been used for decades.
Governor Newsom announced a moratorium on executions in 2019 ... and in 2022, he began transferring inmates sentenced to death to other prisons. 
The death chamber at San Quentin is being dismantled.
It's a well known prison.
It has housed a number of infamous prisoners including Charles Manson, Richard Ramirez, Sirhan Sirhan and Scott Peterson.
Two famously rehabbed former inmates are Merle Haggard and actor Danny Trejo.
We used the ABC7 Bay Area app to send out this alert - it made it easy for you to watch the governor's announcement live.

Leaders in San Francisco are trying to revive a proposal to address a specific section of the city's homeless population.
Yesterday, Business owners joined Supervisor Rafael Mandelman outside City Hall, calling on the city to reconsider a plan to *end unsheltered homelessness over the next three years.
It would add two to three thousand shelter beds.
But a recent city report says that would come with a hefty price tag of almost one and a half *billion dollars.
On top of that - some homeless advocates argue shelter beds aren't the answer... 


Advocates say that's because in some instances, people can become essentially stuck in the shelter and never get connected to more permanent housing... which ends up leaving fewer shelter beds for people on the street.
Mandelman is fighting back against the shelter bed cost estimate - claiming it shouldn't be that much.
He argues - what's being done now isn't working and it's time to try something new.

And we'll start there-- Sandhya giving us a good look at it all. Sandhya?
 Our next of this storm by the numbers -- at least 900 trees and branches came crashing down in San Francisco from Tuesday's storm.
That's from the city's Public Works departments.
Since New's Year's Eve... PG&E says it has removed more than 13 thousand trees across its service area that have damaged the utility's infrastructure.
 Tonight -- we're going to take you by the numbers to try to capture the force this storm brought.
First - the power outages.
PG&E says about 500 *thousand families and businesses in the Bay Area lost power at some point yesterday.
At its peak -- there were 240 thousand outages at once.
Right now - PG&E says ore than 38 thousand customers are currently in the dark.
But many are more than tired of these repeated mass outages.
ABC7 News Reporter Tim Johns is in the newsroom. Tim, you've heard from a lot of frustrated people tonight.
Frustration is pretty high for some folks in communities up and down the peninsula. 
One neighbor I spoke with today telling me, the problems from the persistent storms have even made her and her family consider moving. 
ABC7 News did reach out to San Mateo County officials several days ago about the road leading to Carrillo's house. 
They say while the repair process has begun, their best guess is that the roadway will remain closed until October or November.  
I'm live in the studio tonight, Tim Johns, ABC7 News. 
The wildest weather event we saw today -- this time was in Los Angeles.
People watched in awe as a tornado touched down in the east neighborhood of Montebello.


The National Weather Service has rated this storm an "E-F one" on the tornado scale.
That means the winds were anywhere from 86 to 110 miles per hour... the scale goes from zero to five, five being the most intense.
The winds ripped the roofs off numerous buildings, damaged cars and injured at least one person.


The tornado was on the ground for two to three minutes and traveled about half a mile.
The weather service says the damage path is 50 yards wide.

The areas of the Santa Cruz Mountains have been some of the hardest hit by these storms.
But tonight -- a true act of teamwork to make sure everyone is safe and cared for.
ABC7 News Reporter Lauren Martinez has this story you'll see only on 7.
We're getting a look at just how dangerous windy conditions were as yesterday's storm blew through The Santa Cruz Mountains. 


This video was recorded yesterday afternoon in Boulder Creek. 
The wind gusts were strong enough to knock over several trees inside this RV park on the San Lorenzo River. 
We know at least five people have died as a result of these storms.
All from falling trees.
But tonight - a San Francisco police sergeant is in the hospital after a tree came crashing onto his police vehicle by Lake Merced.
ABC7 News Reporter J.R. Stone is following the story.
 a falling tree just *barely missed hitting a driver on Highway 92 in half moon bay.
The tense video was shot by another driver just a short way behind.


this was on westbound highway 92.. heading into half moon bay.
the driver filming stopped in time... and no other injuries reported there.
 the oakland zoo says six birds -- including an endangered hooded vulture -- escaped after this tree fell and tore the mesh on their aviary.
the birds have *not left zoo grounds.. but haven't been retrieved yet either.
the zoo tweeted - quote - "None of these birds pose a threat to the public, other Zoo animals, or our native wildlife."
 The storm has cleared and the skies have opened.
A brief but vibrant rainbow appeared around 6-30 today... right next to the Bay Bridge.
It was only there for about 15 minutes.
A pretty cap to what was an extraordinary California storm.
  Other developing news now...San Francisco police are investigating after a body was found in the water off Pier 39. 
Officers were called to the Pier and located the body at about 5 o'clock this evening.
The body has not been identified. 
Police say, at this point, there are no signs of foul play, but they're asking anyone with information that might be connected to the case to contact SFPD.  
 Take a look at this road in the North Bay, it looks like an earthquake hit.
This is Redwood Boulevard near the Marin County Airport in the Novato area.
Marin County officials say the road has buckled due to a slide and is closed indefinitely.
It does run next to 101, but at this time the county says there is no threat to the freeway.
And the name of that San Francisco police officer has not yet been released.

The day-long ordeal that ended up being an awesome story of community in Oakland.
First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
Now the latest in the hush money case against former President Donald Trump.
Tonight the U.S. Secret Service is coordinating security plans with the N-Y-P-D in the event Trump is indicted and brought to court. 
This all comes after he claimed over the weekend -- without evidence -- that he would be arrested tomorrow.
The former President has not yet been charged with a crime... but has still been urging supporters to protest over the investigation into his campaign finances.
The Manhattan District Attorney has been investigating Trump for the alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.
Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen already pleaded guilty to federal campaign violations and says he helped arrange the payments at Trump's discretion. 
But a close ally of the former president, Robert Costello testified to a grand jury today -- saying Cohen previously told him the opposite.

 
The grand jury is now off until Wednesday. 
The Manhattan District Attorney has still given law enforcement partners no indication of when or whether an indictment could come.   
Earlier we spoke with our ABC7 News Political Analyst Jackie Speier about the possibility of an indictment against Trump. 
She believes he could possibly benefit by it for his 20-24 presidential campaign. 


Speier says the case prosecutors are building against Trump is too weak to ultimately lead to a conviction. 
She points to the claim that Trump tried tampering with 2020 election results in Georgia as a much stronger case.

A grieving family believes they have been robbed of a sacred space used to remember their lost loved one.
Back in August "Manuel Huizar" ""hway-zarr"" was killed while on the job working at his Safeway in Willow Glen.

ABC7 News Reporter Lauren Martinez has tonight's story you'll see - only on 7.
In a case that drew national attention...
A woman was sentenced to prison today for admitting to planning the kidnapping of a baby in San Jose.
A judge sentenced "Yesenia "yes-en-ee-ah" Ramirez" to 13 years and four months.
Ramirez cried for about 40 minutes in court -- apologizing for kidnapping baby Brandon back in April.
Prosecutors say she took the biological mother shopping to distract her while a boyfriend took the three month old boy.
Her accomplice -- "Jose Portillo" "Por-tee-yo" -- was sentenced to five years in prison.
Many neighbors in the North Bay are worried tomorrow's storm will cause even more problems.
Two homes had to be red-tagged on Cooper Drive in Santa Rosa last week because of landslide dangers.
Today, city crews used heavy equipment to dump gravel on the saturated hill... hoping to hold down that heavy earth from sliding down to the homes.
Be careful if your morning commute takes you through Livermore tomorrow.
You can see there from Sky 7 - an edge of I-580 has collapsed.
This is at North Flynn Road - if you look closely there's a large crack through one of the lanes.
At least one lane in the eastbound direction is closed tonight... 
Caltrans is asking drivers to take alternate routes to avoid the backup.
A federal judge has blocked a California state law that requires new semiautomatic handguns to have certain safety features.
The ruling from a U-S District Judge in Orange County found the law violates the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment.
It's the latest in a line of decisions striking down state gun laws following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that expanded gun rights. 
The ruling will not take effect for 14 days to give the state a chance to appeal.
By now we all know of downtown San Francisco's struggles to recover from the pandemic.

ABC7 News Reporter J-R Stone was there with a look at how this might shape the city's recovery for the future. 
Happening tomorrow... 
San Francisco's board of supervisors will get to work on how to eliminate the city's homelessness problem.
Supervisor Rafael Mandelman will hold a City Hall press conference beforehand... to push for his plan.

Also ... while we may be tired of all this rain... Tahoe ski resorts are loving it, to an extent. The good and the bad for skiers and ski resorts. We'll talk to the folks at Heavenly resorts.
But first ... some are calling yesterday's storm that pushed out today... a once in a ten-year event... one that was so unexpectedly powerful, not because scientists had it wrong, but because mother nature truly pulled a couple of surprising turns.
Joining us live now is ABC7 weather anchor spencer Christian!
**why winds so strong
**how similar to hurricane
**role of climate change
**how likely to happen again?
Mudslides.
Downed trees.
Falling glass.
That powerful level three storm that rolled through yesterday left behind a major mess -- and the cleanup is just getting started.
Good afternoon
I'm Larry Beil.
And I'm Kristen Sze.
We have team live team coverage today on the aftermath of that storm.
From San Francisco, to the East Bay, to the Peninsula -- our crews are spread across the Bay Area, to give us a look at what people are dealing with.
But first, we want to start with ABC7's Spencer Christian.
Spencer, yesterday's storm was the strongest we've seen in March?
Some good news for now, crews have cleared the debris from the road which is making access a lot easier for the people who live here.
Still Woodside Town officials tell us that the evacuation advisory for the 30 or so homes further up from the slide are going to stay in place.
The slide was some of the dangerous aftermath of a powerful storm, the type neighbors tell me they haven't seen in years. 
The already narrow Patrol Road was reduced even further after this mudslide led to an evacuation advisory for more than 30 homes.
The slide attributed to the storm that impacted much of the Bay Area Tuesday.
A storm that shocked  residents like Donald MacLeod who's lived at his home since 1964.
 normally we're sheltered because we got a mountain race between here and the ocean. We're not gonna shout it. That's not a redwood trees were flapping back and forward like, like sails in the wind. It was a quite an extraordinary experience.
It was that storm, Woodside officials say led to the slide.
They first got word of it at 5 in the morning Wednesday, when a resident called for help, concerned that a tree was going to fall into their home. 
 as crews arrived on scene, they noticed that the tree was falling into the structure. They noticed a slight landslide that over the course of time got increasingly worse. At that point, we made a decision just to let the residents in the area know that it could potentially get worse. 
Officials say the slide originated at one property and the threatened one lower, those two homes saw forced evacuations.
With road access for emergency crews and residents threatened, San Mateo County sheriffs deputies went door to door to the other homes to advise homeowners to leave. 
Most we spoke with did not leave but still took precautions. 
 i parked my truck and the other side of the slide here so I could make sure I can always get in and out 
Geologists were brought on scene to evaluate the stability of the slide, the experts expected to continue monitoring it through at least the rest of the week.
As for the residents who stayed behind...they like the rest of the Bay Area are looking forward to the storms and all of the impacts they leave behind to give way to sunshine. 
 That's why I came to California. He was the back of my mind I born in Glasgow.
So at last check with the Woodside Town manager, the home at the lower end of the slide was still evacuated.
Professionals continue to evaluate that slide and will do so through the rest of the week, they'll also keep that evacuation advisory in place.
For now those officials tell me that their hoping for a let up of the rain.
Live in Woodside, Zach Fuentes ABC7 news. 
This is cell phone video given to ABC7 news showing the moment one of the trees along the Embarcadero came crashing down, pilling on top of other trees that had already fallen. 
Today, we came back to Sue Berman Park to see the extent of the damage and realized how close the trees came to falling on some tents on the sidewalk. 
For the Department of Public Works it was another intense day of removing trees throughout the city.
An estimated 900 trees and branches all over the city fell yesterday during what meteorologists are now calling a bomb cyclone--unusual for this region. On some streets, power and MUNI  lines were damaged.  In a few cases, the trees were so large, they blocked the entire street from one end of the sidewalk to the other.
Crews from Public Works were also assessing the damage to the 3rd Street Bridge near the ball park after several industrial barges got loose slamming into the bridge.
The bridge opened in 1933 and recently went through extensive rehabilitation work. 
Tommy Bombon has a boat docked nearby and came to see the damage in person. 
Structural engineers will inspect the bridge tomorrow once the tide is low. 
P-G-and-E says at one point yesterday the number of people who were without power in the Bay Area was 240-thousand customers.
It has brought in crews from as far away as Humboldt County to help fix damaged lines and restore power.
P-G-and-E says while a majority of customers do have their electricity back, its crews are facing some lengthy repairs right now.


The utility says this is the 14th storm its had to respond too this year and it's been relying heavily on mutual aid.
A mudslide in San Mateo County prompted an evacuation advisory for more than 30 homes.
It happened in the Town of Woodside on Patrol Road.
Officials ARE concerned that if the road gives out to the slide, emergency access would be cut off.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes is live in Woodside with the progress crews have been able to make.
We now know at least five people died as a result of yesterday's powerful level three storm.
All of them were killed by falling trees.
Two happened in San Francisco.
One was at 23rd and Lincoln Way, right by Golden Gate Park.
The other was at Post and Polk Streets -- leaving one person dead and another critically injured.
The third incident happened in Oakland.
Sky7 was over Lake Merritt, where a tree fell on a man, killing him.
In San Mateo County, the CHP says a person in a work van was crushed by a falling tree.
This was in Portola Valley, on Alpine Drive.
Today, that victim was identified as 29-year-old Jesus Ivan Cruz Diaz of San Jose.
And another person was killed when a tree crushed their car in Rossmoor.
It happened on Stanley Dollar Drive.
The Contra Costa Fire Department says one other person in the car survived.
And San Francisco Police have just confirmed a sergeant who was on-duty suffered life-threatening injuries when a tree fell on him yesterday on Brotherhood Way, in the Park Merced area of the city. 
That sergeant is in the hospital this afternoon. 
He is a 16 year veteran of the department.
His family is asking for privacy.
San Francisco saw more than 900 downed trees and branches. 
As the dust settled today, crews got a better pictures of the damage.  
ABC7 news reporter Lyanne Melendez joins us live from San Francisco with more on the cleanup.
Good afternoon
I'm Larry  Beil...
And I'm Ama Daetz...
There is heightened security at the mall and they will be even more vigilant on Wednesday and that's when public schools in San Francisco have that shorter day.  The supervisor who represents that district believes that social media has everything to do with these fights. 
This is one of several social media posts showing several youths fighting inside Stonestown Galleria, last Thursday and again Friday after school. 
What triggered the brawl is unknown but the motivation seems clear.
Supervisor Myrna Melgar represents the district where the mall is located, near San Francisco State University.  As we witnessed today, Stonestown is frequented by students from several nearby high schools and the college. But the fighting has been a more recent development.
Kevin Luna works in the mall. 
We reached out to Brookfield Properties but they never returned our call. Still, it was obvious today that security has been bolstered, with San Francisco Police monitoring the premises. 
San Francisco Unified would not confirm if any of their students were involved, citing privacy issues. 
Supervisor Melgar believes the violence may be a byproduct of isolation during COVID.
Melgar has now called for a hearing asking that the mayor's office, the superintendent of schools, the district attorney and chief of police present a plan to address the recent acts of violence that have surfaced at the mall and recently at some of the public schools. 
Just recently the San Mateo County Board of Education filed a lawsuit in federal court against a number of social media companies claiming that they are harming the mental health of children.  President Biden in the State of the Union address said these companies should be held accountable for collecting data from children and then advertising to them. In the newsroom, Lyanne Melendez ABC7 news. 
BART riders, you may notice more officers during the evening commute.

The last two incidents involved several dozen youths.  
ABC7 news reporter  Lyanne Melendez is live with steps the city is taking.  
The C-H-P is trying to figure out what happened before two Uber passengers were struck on a freeway in Livermore last night.
One of the passengers died and the other was seriously injured.
The Uber driver apparently called 9-1-1 to report an uncooperative passenger.
After some sort of altercation, the passengers got out on 580 where they were hit by a car.
In a statement, Uber says "We are currently investigating and are working with law enforcement on their investigation." 
That breaking news is happening in Livermore.
Catrans has closed at least one lane of eastbound Interstate 580 at North Flynn Road for emergency road repairs.
It's at a spot where an edge of the road has collapsed.
If you look closely at the lane farthest to the right, there is a crack down the middle of the lane.
The worry is that it may get bigger since it is next to that mudslide.

BART says starting TODAY, an additional eight to 18 officers per shift will join the 10 officers currently patrolling the system.
The increase police presence comes after BART board director Janice Li ""Lee"" talked about what she calls a lack of investment in the system.
She spoke at a packed event in San Francisco LAST WEEK, saying BART is trying to do more with less.
Riders say they are now dealing with delays and cancellations on regular a regular basis.
Safety is another major concern.
Riders tells us they've seen Crisis Intervention Teams on trains.
But Li ""Lee"" says the issues plaguing San Francisco are bleeding onto BART.


Riders tell us un-housed individuals are often taking up a full row of seats during commute hours... and sometimes doing drugs while on board.
BART POLICE CHIEF ED ALVAREZ SAID IN A STATEMENT --
"This is the biggest train deployment we've had in the 25 years I've been here, if not the history of the BART Police Department. We're going to be doubling down on our presence in the system."

People all across the bay area are reeling from the impacts of yesterday's storm and its powerful winds...
We have learned falling trees killed five people... in addition to causing massive damage.
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.
We have ABC7 news team coverage tonight, tracking the concern over the glass falling from high rise buildings, as well as a landslide threat on the peninsula.
But let's begin our coverage wtih ABC7 news meteorologist Sandhya Patel for the very latest on the conditions...  
The already narrow Patrol Road was reduced even further after this mudslide led to an evacuation advisory for more than 30 homes.
The slide attributed to the storm that impacted much of the Bay Area Tuesday.
A storm that shocked  residents like Donald MacLeod who's lived at his home since 1964.

All around the island city of Alameda, you can see the effects of those destructive winds. 
Officials says the wind reached over 70 miles an hour in some parts. 
Many people are dealing with property damage... downed trees... and a lot more. 
ABC7 News Reporter Anser Hassan ""UN'-sir   HUSS'-sun"" has the details. 
This was a really scary situation for folks who were walking in this area yesterday afternoon. In fact, one of our own employees was hit by a small piece of glass that fell from above. Thankfully, she's okay. You can see here... part of the street is still blocked off. Shards of glass are still on the sidewalk.
The most damage happened here at the Salesforce East tower. The city tell us there's one broken window on at least 19 different floors.
We did speak to the spokesperson for the Department of Building and Inspections. 
He said (insert answer!) 
He also told us that the department has issued notices of violation to all of these buildings. 
That will require them to secure broken windows, replace the glass as soon as possible, and have all of their windows evaluated by a licensed engineer within the next 14 days.
Sadly at least five people died as a result of yesterday's powerful storm.
All of them were killed by falling trees.

And another person was killed when a tree crushed their car in Rossmoor.
It happened on Stanley Dollar Drive.
The Contra Costa Fire Department says one other person in the car survived.
Yesterday's wind gusts were enough to rearrange the patio furniture outside one high-rise apartment in San Francisco. 


The couch got moved all the way to the street down below!
The owners posted this video on tik tok as the winds kicked up. 
When they checked outside, they spotted their couch flying through the air before in landed several stories below. 
we'll have much more on the storm damage.. after the break. 
We now know that windows at four different buildings in downtown San Francisco shattered yesterday during the wind storms. 
This now brings the total number of high-rises where windows have broken to five.
Last week, windows broke at the Bank of American Building at 555 California Street.
And yesterday, windows broke at 1400 Mission Street, 50 California Street, 301 Mission Street, and 350 Mission Street
And that is where we find ABC7 News anchor Liz Kreutz...
And San Francisco Police have just confirmed a sergeant who was on-duty suffered life-threatening injuries when a tree fell on him yesterday on Brotherhood Way, in the Park Merced area of the city. 
That sergeant is in the hospital this afternoon. 
He is a 16 year veteran of the department.
His family is asking for privacy.

Good Morning.
It's Tuesday, March 21st.
First let's check your Accuweather forecast.
Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.


We start our storm coverage in the South Bay.
The commute could be messy and slippery for drivers out there.
ABC 7 news reporter Amanda del Castillo is live in San Jose checking out the latest conditions.
Amanda -- 
This morning's storm *is expected to bring heavy rain at times...
With that, a slight possibility of thunder.
And of course, gusty winds which will likely be the strongest over the hills, across the region.
In the last few months, we've learned what that rain, paired with powerful winds can do. We could see more tree limbs and trees go down.
Power outages are not out of the question.
These are all conditions that have kept clean-up crews very busy since the start of the year. 
Valley Water tells us in 20-23, there has been plenty to do for the 32 maintenance workers there.


Certainly keeping up with demand during one of the busiest storm seasons to hit the Bay Area.
We've witnessed rain leading to flooded roads and clogged storm drains... 
Widespread potholes and snapped trees... 
Within the City of San Jose, this falls under the responsibility of the city's Department of Transportation.
In the next half-hour-- hear how D-O-T crews are managing and staying prepared.
For now, we're keeping our eyes on weather conditions in the South Bay.
Right now--- 
In San Jose, Amanda  del Castillo,  ABC7 News.
Good morning
Our goal is to catch you up on all the news around the bay area... INCLUDING the rain and wind... plus san francisco owes gamers a "thank you"...
and it's been 60 years to the day... since alcatraz shut down... we'll talk more about that....
We also have segments like 77 seconds of fun and.... for the third time in the span of a week - one person is being nominated as the most important person in the world today...
We're also doing things like dREW'S emoji forecast...

 
Time now for the lead...
Many neighbors in the North Bay are watching this morning's storm closely, worried it could cause even more problems.
Two homes had to be red-tagged on Cooper Drive in Santa Rosa last week because of landslide dangers.
Yesterday, city crews used heavy equipment to dump gravel on the saturated hill, hoping to hold down that heavy earth from sliding down to the homes.
Let's head over to the south bay where ABC 7 news reporter Amanda Del Castillo is monitoring the weather moving into the area there.
Time now for first focus - where we pick a couple stories and take a closer look at them....
Today we're talking about a big boost to san francisco...
And the 2nd largest school district in the country... is closed...
We begin with thousands of visitors are in San Francisco for this year's Game Developers Conference.
ABC7 News Reporter J-R Stone gives us a look at how the conference is helping the city's post-pandemic recovery.
Happening today.
San Francisco's board of supervisors will get to work on how to eliminate the city's homeless population.
Supervisor Rafael Mandelman will hold a City Hall news conference before the board meeting to push for his plan.
It calls for two thousand new shelter beds over the next three years, along with other supportive housing.
Today's meeting will also discuss Mayor London Breed's 25 million dollar request for police overtime pay... and the city's pandemic moratorium on rental evictions.
In Marin County, many community members plan to show up at the county board of supervisors meeting today.
They're protesting a new housing development approved for Marin City.
The property will be a 5-story, 74-unit apartment complex made up mostly of low-income housing.
Activists say among the concerns with the project is congestion.
There's just one way in and one way out of Marin City - a community that already has the highest density of housing in the county.

 
A spokesperson for the county tells ABC7 News - the project is out of their hands because it's part of the state law streamlining housing construction.
A petition is circulating to stop the development.
Today in Oakland, city councilmembers are expected to pump tens of millions of dollars into affordable housing.
ABC7 News reporter Leslie Brinkley has a preview of what will be built.
T Here are homeless encampments all over Oakland. Residents often struggle to find affordable housing. For the first time Oakland will take  $50 million  from Measure U housing bonds and combine it with another $13 million to jumpstart affordable housing in the city. 
Oakland's mayor made the big announcement flanked by four councilmembers.
According to Oakland Housing and Community Development the Measure U funds  can include new construction as well as the acquisition and conversion of existing buildings. Transit centric units are likely to get actually built near West Oakland BART and Lake Merritt. 
Housing for the homeless is part of the plan.

Busy is an understatement.
Every turn we made... if the street was lined with trees... crews were hard at work.
Here's what they're dealing with... a mess and mangle of branches, massive trees and more.
Now the race is on to get as much cleared before next week's rainy conditions.
Residents are also bracing for more bad weather to come, next week.
From their experience dealing with so much wind and rain recently--
I'm told plans include staying home, waiting it out, and watching for trees.

We're now getting a better idea of the storm's damage and impact by the numbers.
When it comes to power outages ... P-G-and-E says about 500 *thousand people -- including families and businesses lost power in the bay area at some point Tuesday.
At its peak, there were 240 thousand outages at once.
This morning, as you can see, things are a lot better.
P-G-and-E says crews are now working to restore power to about 25-thousand customers.
The biggest impact is still in the East Bay with more than 12-thousand still in the dark.
If the harsh weather kept you from skiing at Tahoe this season, you'll have plenty more time.
Heavenly Mountain,  Palisades,  Northstar,   Kirkwood and Sugar Bowl are among resorts extending their season.
Most usually close in  mid- april, but they're now staying open until the end of  april.
Some even pushing into the second week of May. 


Even better news for Mammoth Mountain.
The resort popular with Southern California skiers is extending its season until at least the "end" of July! 
Mammoth says it's just one storm away from breaking the all-time record of 668 inches of snowfall for the season, that's 55 and a half feet.

A search is underway right now for a missing 7-year-old boy in   Monterey County.
The Coast Guard received calls about the incident just before 8 last night at Moss Landing State Park.
The boy's 3-year-old brother told them his mother went missing as well.
Cal Fire crews found her and took her to the hospital.
But the 7-year-old has not yet been found.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is trying to expand a controversial rule, which forbids classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, to high school students. 
The law, also known as the "Don't Say Gay" law, bans those kinds of lessons from grades 4 to 12 ... unless required by existing state standards or as part of reproductive health instruction that students can choose not to take.
The initial law DeSantis championed last spring banned lessons in kindergarten through the third grade. 
  Our top story tonight.
A blitz of burglaries in Oakland's Chinatown -- all carried out in one night... and all within a few blocks.

The company awarded the contract will start testing them out at a station later this year and the new gates will be installed  systemwide by 2026.
While the exact design has not been picked, BART says the new gates will cut down significantly on fare evasion and be technologically advanced.
Happening now -- PG&E is getting a handle on those remaining power outages...
At last check -- about 13 thousand are currently in the dark tonight.
It has been a frustrating couple of months to say the least... particularly from neighbors along the Peninsula, South Bay and Santa Cruz Mountains.
Now to the East Bay -- where repair work continues on the 580 freeway in Livermore.
Two eastbound lanes will remain closed near Flynn Lane until tomorrow -- maybe longer.
It's all because this freeway retaining wall gave way from all the recent rain.
 The erosion also caused a crack on the freeway, which led to the closure. 
  A sad outcome for fans of long-time Bay Area radio personality- J-V of  Wild 94-9. 
His body was found at Pier 39 last night... almost a month after he vanished.
On this morning's radio show...
His co-hosts struggled  as they faced the news.

 
"Jeff Vandergrift", J-V,  started  his own radio show called the Doghouse.
In its nearly three decades it eventually became the highest rated radio morning show in San Francisco radio history. 


In 2021 - J-V had opened up about his struggle with Lyme Disease. 
     When he disappeared a month ago, he left behind clear signs that he would not be coming home.
J-V was 55 years old. 
Farther south...PEOPLE IN THE FLOOD-RAVAGED TOWN OF PAJARO ""PAH-HAH-ROW"" are being allowed to go back home after almost two *weeks of evacuation.
But as these neighbors survey the damage, the true cost of the flooding there -- may come to hit us all.
ABC7 News Reporter Lauren Martinez explains why.
 PG&E crews are assessing the damage of all the downed trees and powerlines in Santa Cruz County.
Officials say they've found more than 300 locations with severe damage.

 
 Right now more than 60 PG&E crews are working to restore power within Santa Cruz County.
In the North Bay they are racing to save a famous houseboat that is literally sinking.
Droneview 7 went over the "Taj Mahal" at Sausalito Yacht Harbor and it is flooded following Tuesday's storm.
The houseboat has been since the 1970s but is now four to five feet under water.
Its caretaker tells ABC7 news they are running pumps and using divers but just can't seem to raise it.
It is likely the tilt will get worse and the houseboat will have to be demolished.
Friday morning at 10 the Chinatown community will be coming together for an emergency meeting about this with police. 
There is a volunteer security crew that patrols the area overnight and the initial thought going forward is to add an additional patrol crew in those overnight hours. 
J.R. Stone ABC 7 News. 
  Happening tomorrow- Teachers with the Oakland Unified School District are planning what's known as a "wildcat strike".
    It's  over their ongoing contract negotiations.
A "wildcat strike" means the walkout has not been authorized by the Union, in this instance the Oakland Education Association.
 Teachers are striking over what they say is bad-faith bargaining by the district.
They say the district has repeatedly canceled negotiation sessions.
When asked for comment the school district said classes will continue as scheduled.
In Los Angeles... schools will *reopen Friday after a massive 3-day workers' strike for better pay and conditions.
  That breaking news is in Rodeo where at least one person is dead and a driver is under arrest following a chase the ended in a crash.
We're told by police the suspect was wanted for stealing a car... that person was driving the white S-U-V.
The driver crashed into a car at Fourth Street and Parker Avenue... killing at least one person.
Again, this is happening right now in Rodeo.
    The suspected car thief is under arrest.
Good Evening,  I'm Ama Daetz.
and I'm Dan Ashley.
It's a storm we won't soon forget -- but we've had a lot of those lately.
And tonight's storm system is *still hanging overhead.
We have our full team out live across the Bay Area... with complete coverage of the damage that's continuing to cause problems tonight.
First let's get to ABC7 Meteorologist Sandhya Patel with the action we're seeing now...


First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
Due to the storm's impacts, both Muir Woods State Park and Alcatraz will be closed tomorrow for cleanup.
You can find that -- as well as the status of schools and public transit schedules -- on our full list of live storm updates.
It's the top thing you're clicking on right now on our website, abc7 news dot com.
More storm coverage and news -- right after this.
We'll be right back.


An unusual March storm roars into the Bay Area.
We've seen more than our share of storms packing strong winds and rain, but nothing like this--
 this one looked more like a hurricane and as it came ashore.


What this storm did has become a familiar scene.
Trees coming down all over the place and in some instances with deadly consequences.
We know at least one person died when a tree crushed a vehicle in Portola Valley.
Others narrowly escaped.  
Look at just how close a driver came to getting crushed by a tree in Newark... the man is sitting in the front seat with the tree on top of his truck.


The winds... powerful enough to shatter high rise windows in San Francisco.
And on the Bay Bridge a truck overturned during the commute blocking all but one lane on the lower deck.
This backed up traffic onto San Francisco city streets.
A storm path so wide -- you could see it from space.
Just take a look at this satellite view as today's storm swirled into the West Coast -- with the winds lashing the Bay Area.
Happening now -- major power outages are spread all over the Bay Area tonight.
At last check - more than 123 thousand P-G-and-E customers are without power.
At one point today the number was close to 200-thousand.
Highway 101 is closed in both directions right now on the Peninsula between Ralston Avenue and Hillsdale Boulevard so P-G-and-E repair some lines.
That's where we find ABC7 News Reporter Lauren Martinez -- live with the latest on this major closure.
Lauren?
We have tragic news from the peninsula. 
One person has died after a tree fell on a moving van on Alpine Road in Portola Valley this afternoon.
The incident happened near 280.
Emergency crews attempted to remove the victim from the work van, when more trees came crashing down .... crushing a nearby vehicle.
CHP officials say the victim was on their way home from work...and that it was a freak accident.
In Newark - a massive tree came crashing down on multiple vehicles on Mowry Avenue this afternoon. 
 two people were stuck inside a truck. 
The two individuals were taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. 
One of the victims suffered  minor injuries.
We caught some choppy surf near the home of the San Francisco Giants today. 
Three larges barges were even sent crashing into the historic 3rd street bridge next to the ballpark.
Thankfully no one was hurt. 
ABC7 News Reporter J.R. Stone continues our team coverage. 
In the East Bay... Caltrans says it could take weeks to complete a temporary fix of the storm damaged lanes of Eastbound i-580 on the way to the Altamont pass
All the rain undermined a 250-foot section of retaining wall next to the freeway not far from Flynn Road in Livermore.
The erosion has also caused a crack on the freeway, forcing the closure of two lanes-- leaving only two lanes open to traffic.


Caltrans says the temporary fix would likely involve the installation of piles to prop up the right two lanes. 
Eventually those lanes may have to be rebuilt.
A downed tree is to blame for this afternoon's derailment of a Amtrak train in  Contra  Costa County.
The Eastbound train derailed around 3-25, about a half mile east of Port  Costa.. that's between Crockett and Martinez. 
None of the 55 passengers was hurt. 
all were taken to the Martinez station..
The derailment is leading to major delays on Capitol Corridor service between the Bay Area and Sacramento.
Exactly a week ago last Tuesday, glass fell from the 43rd floor of the high rise at 5-5-5 California Street.
Investigators believe wind likely caused that window to break. 
People who were inside the building say they heard windows creaking and felt like the building was shaking all day. 
Happening now...
A live look from the Bay Bridge Caltrans camera - and the good news...
it is *finally back open in the Eastbound direction.
It was closed almost four *hours -- right during rush hour.
This was the reason why -- the strong winds toppled a big rig on the lower deck -- eventually stopping anyone from getting across...
We heard it took around two and a half hours for drivers to reroute all the way around to Oakland.
ABC7 News reporter Tim Johns has been following the mess for us all day.
He joins us live from the roof tonight. 
Tim? 
It's important to note both directions of 101 will be closed.
They expect this closure to last for an hour or 30 minutes.
This is all to work on line repair.
We certainly saw plenty of downed powerlines today here in the South Bay.
Again PG&E has requested a full closure in both directions of 101 from  Ralston Avenue to  Hillsdale Boulevard.
They expect the closure to last until midnight.
For a second week in a row...
Glass was falling from the sky in San Francisco.
Powerful, gusty winds likely blew out this window from a high-rise building in near Sacramento and Davis... a block away from the Embarcadero Center.
ABC7 News got this video shortly after it happened around 1 p-m.
We also got a report of shattered glass from a blown out window on the east tower.
So far, no word of any serious injuries in either case.
Here's a little perspective to sum up this season of storms so far... from ABC7 Meteorologist Drew Tuma.
Today's storm put San Francisco at more than 30 inches of rain since October 1st.
Meaning... this period has been the wettest in the city since 1997-98.
He also says more rain could be coming again -- early next week.
Ama, Today - that overturned big rig closing four lanes of traffic on the Bay Bridge this afternoon and causing traffic backups throughout downtown San Francisco right during the height of rush hour.  
And, of course, this scene is in very familiar memory.
Just last Tuesday - exactly one week ago -- another big rig was toppled on the Richmond Bridge... backing up traffic *there for hours.
I'm live in San Francisco tonight, Tim Johns, ABC7 News. 
One person is dead after a tree fell on a car this evening.
Contra Costa Fire Department said it happened around 7P-M on Stanely Dollar Drive in Rossmoor.
The passenger in the car died after today's dangerous winds toppled the tree.
Fire Officials said the driver of the vehicle had no life-threatening injuries. 
The scene is now clear and has been re-opened to traffic.
I'm Kristen Sze.
You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.

We're explore the new call for solutions.
But first ...the CEO of one the world's most popular apps... TikTok... in the hot seat today on Capitol Hill... grilled over whether the app is safeguarding Americans user' data against potential Chinese government access.


That was TikTok CEO Shou Chew before House lawmakers today.
And joining us now... CNET reporter Abrar Al-Heeti, who has been following this tech story closely. Abrar, thanks for your time.
**Extraordinary hearing... explain how this hugely popular video app is a national security concern, a potential tool for spying by a rival nation?
**Explain why the concern... Tiktok is a China-based company... it is not, however, owned by the Chinese government... but what's the worry, for the U.S. government? For private American citizens?
**It's already banned by some federal agencies, right?
**Chinese law allows the government to compel companies to turn over data, right? Different in the U.S.?
**the CEO said America data is stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel... clearly saying there's no reason for concern even if the Chinese government demanded data... how solid is that firewall actually? is what he said reassuring?
**is this method of storing and managing data unusual?
**Is the reverse situation not a problem because China has banned American social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat?
**The Republican House Energy Chair said this...


**Is this a bipartisan concern?
**Have there been documented cases of TikTok or other Chinese-owned internet-based companies turning over information to their government?
**Why does TikTok want to play ball? Would being banned in the U.S. prove devastating for the company?
**Do Americans seem concerned about this? Or is it mainly a concern at the nation-state level?
**Do you have any concerns using TikTok, more so than any other social media company you give so much info about yourself to?
**What did Tiktok promise today? Any actions coming down to avoid the ban?
Now at four ...
The race to save a beloved landmark in Sausalito.
It's literally sinking after this most recent stretch of wild weather.
Good afternoon
I'm Julian Glover.
And I'm Kristen Sze.
As we've been reporting, one positive of all our recent storms is that it's helping much of California get out of the drought.
A new drought monitor is released every Thursday, so let's check in with ABC7 News meteorologist Sandhya Patel for more on today's update.
New Developments in the search for the missing radio host - Jeffrey Vandergrift in San Francisco.
Sadly- San Francisco Medical Examiner's office identified Vandergrift... also known as "JV" as the person found in the water near Pier 39 in San Francisco Wednesday.
JV was reported missing and was last seen leaving his home in San Francisco February 23rd.
He formed his own radio show called the Doghouse... that lasted nearly three decades. 
It eventually became the highest rated radio morning show in San Francisco radio history. 
In 2021 - JV opened up about his struggle with Lyme Disease. 
He died at the age of 55.
A statement shared from Wild 94-9 radio station says...
We are devastated by this news and our thoughts are with JV's family, friends, and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.
JV was special to all of us and will be deeply missed.

Repair work continues on the 580 freeway in Livermore. 
Lane closures caused a major backup this morning, but part of that work is now complete. 
Three eastbound lanes near Flynn Road reopened this afternoon.
Two lanes will remain closed until tomorrow, maybe longer according to Caltrans.
All of the recent rain caused a 250-foot section of retaining wall next to the freeway to give way.
The erosion has also caused a crack on the freeway, which led to the closure.

Some encouraging news for residents forced out of their homes by flooding in the Monterey County town of Pajaro.
The evacuation order there has been lifted...a day earlier than expected. 
However, county officials are warning there are still some safety risks in the area.
Many evacuees have been staying in their cars because the county doesn't have the capacity to take in more people. 
We're now getting a better idea of the storm's damage and impact by the numbers.
When it comes to power outages ... P-G-and-E says about 500-thousand customers -- including families and businesses lost power in the bay area at some point Tuesday.
At its peak, there were 240-thousand customers without power.
This afternoon, as you can see, things are a lot better.
P-G-and-E says crews are now working to restore power to about 18-thousand customers.
The biggest impact is on the Peninsula and in the South Bay.
A search is underway right now for a missing 7-year-old boy in Monterey County.
The Coast Guard received calls just before 8 last night at Moss Landing State Park.
A 3-year-old found alone by a passer-by on the beach .. told them his brother and mother were missing.
Cal Fire crews found her and took her to the hospital.
Our Central Coast affiliate is reporting she died there. 
The 7-year-old still has not yet been found.
Crews are  helping Oakland residents recover after dealing with these back-to-back storms.
There were over 2-hundred reports of fallen trees around the city of Oakland....including a tree that fell on a man's tent near Lake Merritt -- killing the man.
We spoke with Oakland Mayor -Sheng Thao during our Midday show...on how the city's mobile assistance crews will be helping unhoused people ahead of next week's storm.


Mayor Sheng Thao is advising residents to call 3-1-1 instead of 9-1-1 to report  fallen trees. 
The Taj Mahal houseboat has been a fixture on the waterfront for decades, but Tuesday's big storm left it damaged and taking on water.
This video from Droneview 7 shows us what the Sausalito Yacht Harbor looks like now.
That's where we find ABC7 News reporter Cornell Barnard, who's live with this story you'll see Only on 7.
Marin County officials are monitoring a hillside just west of the County Airport.
A mudslide in the area Tuesday evening exposed a PG&E gas line and may have damaged part of an aqueduct that runs from Sonoma County to Marin. 
No gas line or water line breech has been reported and officials say there is no immediate threat to residents.

It crashed down on top of a car causing some serious damage to the vehicle.
This latest storm brought destructive winds to our coast especially in Santa Cruz.
That's where we find  ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey live at the ocean.
Dustin... how are things looking?
I've covered hurricanes before... and today's winds and waves were about as close as I have seen hurricane-like conditions here on the West Coast.
Warnings for winds up to 80 miles per hour today... but that didn't stop people from coming by to see Mother Nature's show.
People we spoke with came from as far as  Alturs to see the incredible waves crash along the coastline near the Surfing Museum Lighthouse.
The wind was pushing the water up and over the cliff and across West Cliff Drive... many times soaking oncoming cars or people watching from the sidewalk.
When the national weather service issued a thunderstorm warning... that's when the awe turned to concern on the coastline.
Two massive cypress trees were uprooted near Natural Bridges... a  prius was crushed underneath.
Santa Cruz County Officials say these powerful winds creates a risk of more downed trees and power outages as the day continues.

Now at 5 -
We're expecting new developments in the two investigations involving Former President Donald Trump.
Police in New York STILL standing by to handle protesters, in the event of an indictment.
But first -- Communities across the bay area still working to recover from this week's storm.
Some neighborhoods are still without power this morning.
And nearly every bay area city dealing with downed trees.
If there is a silver lining to the recent series of storms, it lies in the Snowy Sierra.
Ski resorts in Tahoe announcing an extended season, pushing all the way into the summer. 
Good morning.
It's THURSDAY, MARCH 23
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.


The more serious development involves those classified documents found at Trump's Florida estate.
This morning, a lawyer presenting the former president in the Mar-a-Lago case is preparing to appear before a grand jury.
Just yesterday, a panel of judges rejected Trump's effort to block his lawyer ... Evan Corcoran ... from testifying.
It comes after a judge determined there's compelling preliminary evidence that the former President knowingly mislead his attorneys so they would file a sworn statement -- even though he knew it was false.
Sources say Corcoran is expected to turn over documents as soon as today.
Meanwhile, barricades surround the Manhattan courthouse ... as the D-A investigates whether Trump's alleged "hush money" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels broke campaign spending laws.
Sources say at least one more witness may be called before the Grand Jury decides whether to indict Trump.
Trump declared over the weekend that he would be arrested on Tuesday -- that obviously did not happen.
But New York is still bracing for protests after Trump called his supporters to turn out.
So far, few people seem to be heeding his call.
New developments are expected today in two separate investigations involving former President Donald Trump.
Jobina is tracking it all from the LIVE DESK.

When it comes to power outages -- PG&E says about 500 *thousand families and businesses in the Bay Area lost power at some point Tuesday.
At its peak, there were 240 thousand outages at once.

On the Peninsula, people are frustrated because of the storm damage they've been dealing with for months. 
One woman who lives near Half Moon Bay says a roadway, which she drives to go to town has been damaged since January. 
She says the lack of communication between residents and the county makes the situation worse. 

 
Thousands of people on the Peninsula also remain without electricity.. as they wait for crews to restore power. 


PG&E says since December they've replaced almost 5-thousand power poles and around 850 miles of wire.

But more than 50 percent of the county's water is imported. 
Next month, officials expect to learn how much the storms have benefitted that supply.
Highlighting the importance of continued conservation.
While the vote to remove the emergency declaration would end the call for mandatory 15 percent water use reduction.
Bijoor says water conservation has to become a way of life.

One side of the road was completely blocked  to oncoming traffic.
Griffin watched as a second tree came crashing down moments later… crushing this Prius and injuring the driver inside.

Time now for first focus - where we pick a couple stories and take a closer look at them....
First - we're talking about the latest debate on how to end homelessness in the Bay Area.
and -the latest on all those storms....
We begin with ...the homelessness debate.
Leaders in San Francisco are trying to revive a proposal to address a specific part of the city's homeless population.
Yesterday, Business owners joined Supervisor Rafael Mandelman outside City Hall, calling on the city to reconsider a plan to *end unsheltered homelessness over the next three years.
It would add two to three thousand shelter beds.
But a recent city report says that would come with a hefty price tag of almost one and a half *billion dollars.
Advocates say  people can become essentially stuck in the shelter and never get connected to more permanent housing... which ends up leaving fewer shelter beds for people on the street.
Mandelman is fighting back against the shelter bed cost estimate - claiming it shouldn't be that much.
He argues - what's being done now isn't working and it's time to try something new.
and we also follow the latest on this storm. 
Just take a look at this satellite view taken yesterday as the storm swirled into the West Coast, with the winds lashing the Bay Area.
It's left at least 2 people dead -- and tens of thousands without power.
Today, the man accused of attacking Congresswoman Nancy   Pelosi's husband will be in court today. 
Both the prosecution and defense teams say there's a lot of evidence to go through before trial, which could start this summer. 
David DePape is charged with breaking into their San Francisco home last October, and attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer. 
Depape faces both state and federal charges. 
It's not clear which case is going to go to trial first.
Groups of supporters gathered Tuesday, near former President Trump's  Mar- A- Lago estate.
Many had to park in West Palm Beach and walk over to  Mar- A- Lago  to show their support.

 
Meanwhile, the Palm Beach police department and U-S Secret Service are preparing for possible protests.

On top of that - some homeless advocates argue shelter beds aren't the answer... 


Advocates say that's because in some instances, people can become essentially stuck in the shelter and never get connected to more permanent housing... which ends up leaving fewer shelter beds for people on the street.
Mandelman is fighting back against the shelter bed cost estimate - claiming it shouldn't be that much.
He argues - what's being done now isn't working and it's time to try something new.
New developments, the man accused of firing blanks in a San Francisco synagogue will still face hate crime charges... despite a judge throwing out two hate crime enhancements earlier this month. 
Dmitri Mishin now faces six felony counts including religious terrorism charges with hate crime enhancements. 
According to our media partners at the S-F Standard, Mishin pleaded not guilty to all charges yesterday. 
Mishin's attorney said she will push for the new enhancements to be dropped.
An acclaimed Bay Area author is being recognized for her life's work.
President Biden honored Oakland Native Amy Tan during a ceremony at the White House, yesterday.

Tan's first novel in 19-89 " The Joy Luck Club" was a New-York times best-seller.
Since then Tan has devoted herself to telling stories.
New this morning --
San Francisco is now accepting applications for its pilot program testing the impact of e-bike food delivery in the city.

The city aims to recruit 30 S-F based food delivery workers, and they'll be offered an e-bike for free.
The deadline to apply is March 31st.

A three-day strike has shutdown the country's second largest district. 
Teachers are backing the 30-thousand union employees calling for higher wages.
That includes CAFETERIA WORKERS, BUS DRIVERS, CUSTODIANS AND SPECIAL ED ASSISTANTS.


THE UNION WANTS A 30 PERCENT RAISE. 
IT SAYS RIGHT NOW, THE AVERAGE DISTRICT SUPPORT STAFFER EARNS 25-THOUSAND DOLLARS  A YEAR.

Floods from all of the rain continue to take a toll on farmers across the state. 
Now, some people are worried the challenge for the agriculture industry will eventually mean higher prices at the grocery store. 
Produce expert Michael Marks says some farmers in the Salinas Valley had to restart planting because of floods taking over crops and cattle ranches.
But, before planting again, farmers have to test the land to avoid outbreaks of things like salmonella or e-coli.
There's also concerns about what this means for tomatoes in processed canned goods, like pasta and pizza sauces. 


California grows more than 90-percent of all tomatoes for processed canned goods.
A live concert, featuring local legends, and it's all for a good cause.
The band "Los Tigres Del Norte" and S-A-P Center in San Jose are partnering on donations for their hometown concert.

Many picketing say they don't have adequate benefits. 


Union workers are still fighting for a 30-percent raise. 
The district has offered a 23-percent increase, along with a three-percent cash bonus. 
But, union workers say the increase would be spread out over time *and it's not enough.

The three-day walk out impacted more than 400-thousand families.
Happening today, community members and police in Oakland will hold an emergency meeting -- after eight businesses were burglarized Wednesday night.

The 80-foot tall tree crashed into a home this morning, near Center Boulevard and Saunders Avenue. 
No word on any injuries or if anyone was inside the house. 


 Looking to get a jump on the next storm, some Bay Area residents are running into road blocks trying to remove trees.
 Good Evening,  I'm Ama Daetz.
and I'm Dan Ashley.
We might actually have a nice weekend without any rain.
But it looks like another storm is on the horizon for next week.
Let's get a first look at the forecast with Meteorologist Sandhya Patel.
Open at last!
We'll take you inside Yosemite National Park which has been closed for weeks due to the rough weather.
One of the co-founders of one of  Silicon Valley's most iconic companies has died.
The legacy of Gordon Moore.
And a special holiday celebration in the East Bay.
How it served as way to focus one community on safety and stopping hate crimes.
First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
 "And that's the thing. One pill. One time. It can kill you."
Special Agent in Charge Brian Clark is talking about Fentanyl . . . he says the deadly street drug is being made even more dangerous. 
 "Fentanyl is without a doubt the deadliest threat that we've ever faced in this country. Xylazine mixed with Fentanyl now makes this even deadlier."
The potent mixture on the rise across 48 states . . . and the Bay Area is no exception. 
 "We are detecting Xylazine within the San Francisco Bay area and within the Tenderloin."
And while Tranq is most prevalent on the East Coast --- the DEA is preparing for a surge here. 
 "The  DEA is actively working with our our law enforcement partners, the San Francisco Police Department and the Bay Area law enforcement communities to actively monitor this situation."
The DEA's laboratory reporting  23 percent of fentanyl powder and 7 percent of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA in 2022 contained the deadly animal tranquilizer -- and because it's not an opioid --- it cannot be reversed by Naloxone -- often relied on to save people from an overdose. 
(Alert on Website and DEA's Twitter) 
Prompting a nationwide public safety alert . . . 
 Right now public awareness of the drug and getting knowledge out there to the community can save lives." 
And the lives of children are top of mind . . . 
 "There have been incidents all over the country with children consuming these counterfeit pills. We are seeing  xylazine mixed within these pills so ultimately that is a huge concern for us." 
 "When a deadly drug like tranq which is not intended for humans makes its way into a drug community you've created a very dangerous nexus of potential harm."
And Stanford's Dr. Anna Lembke says it's best for parents to talk openly to their kids. 
 I think proffering education around the incredible lethality around fentanyl and the fact that fentanyl is now found in a lot of counterfeit pills, so that a child may be ingesting fentanyl without realizing it and because such a little bit is so deadly they could die from a single does.

But first ... The Biden administration announced this week that the country's organ transplant system is getting an overhaul.
The system has been heavily criticized for wasted organs, frequent mistakes, and patient deaths.
This is something that our guest Jennifer Erickson.. a Former White House Staffer from the Obama Administration.. recently wrote about in an editorial published in USA Today.
She lost her 31-year-old friend in late December and her father two years ago.. both died while waiting for a transplant.
Jennifer Joins us live now to talk about the reform proposal and why it's so important.
**this is an issue near and dear to your heart... you lost a good friend and your father as both waited for organ transplants?
**you wrote about that... about how a monopoly in charge of the organ donation system killed your friend...
**before we talk more about how the monopoly works and how to break it up and whether the Biden reform announced this week will help... let's talk about why the urgency for action.
**how many americans are on the waitlist at any one time?
**what percentage die without getting that transplant? 
**what are the failings you see by the United Network for Organ Sharing, which has held the government contract to manage the system since 1986?
**They're not recovering all the potential organs? only 1 in 5 donors actually tapped? why?
**The Biden report cites several structural changes... what are the key components? breaking up the network that runs the largest transplant system, modernizing the IT systems, improving transparency..
**HHS launched a new online dashboard? what will that show?
**will these changes help a lot?
**Did you attempt to effect reform during during the Obama years when you worked in the White House?
**What else would you propose?
**what percentage of adults sign up as organ donors? how could that number be increased?

The already narrow Patrol Road was reduced even further after this mudslide led to an evacuation advisory for more than 30 homes.
The slide attributed to the storm that impacted much of the Bay Area Tuesday.
A storm that shocked  residents like Donald  MacLeod who's lived at his home since 1964.
 normally we're sheltered because we got a mountain race between here and the ocean. We're not gonna shout it. That's not a redwood trees were flapping back and forward like, like sails in the wind. It was a quite an extraordinary experience.
It was that storm,  Woodside officials say led to the slide.
They first got word of it at 5 in the morning Wednesday, when a resident called for help, concerned that a tree was going to fall into their home. 
 as crews arrived on scene, they noticed that the tree was falling into the structure. They noticed a slight landslide that over the course of time got increasingly worse. At that point, we made a decision just to let the residents in the area know that it could potentially get worse. 
Officials say the slide originated at one property and the threatened one lower, those two homes saw forced evacuations.
With road access for emergency crews and residents threatened, San  Mateo County sheriffs deputies went door to door to the other homes to advise homeowners to leave. 
Most we spoke with did not leave but still took precautions. 
 i parked my truck and the other side of the slide here so I could make sure I can always get in and out 
Geologists were brought on scene to evaluate the stability of the slide, the experts expected to continue monitoring it through at least the rest of the week.
As for the residents who stayed behind...they like the rest of the Bay Area are looking forward to the storms and all of the impacts they leave behind to give way to sunshine.

Crews in San Francisco are working to make sure high rise windows are safe after several windows were blown out in recent storms.
We saw crews at Mission and Harrison today - cleaning and checking windows.
It's a good reminder to make sure there are no cracks in windows and to secure objects on balconies ahead of the storm.
Now to the East Bay and ABC7 News Reporter Leslie Brinkley looking at the tree troubles we've had in recent storms.
Leslie...
Now at 5-- 
Silicon Valley Bank has been purchased.
What *we know about the new owner -- and the changes *customers need to know about.
An indictment against Former president trump could come as early as today.
Police in New York standing by after Trump spent the weekend speaking to his supporters at a rally in Texas.  
But first -- homeowners and businesses are in a race against time, preparing for the next storm and the damage it's expected to bring to properties across the bay area.


2-thousand pounds of pastrami.
An east bay sandwich shop is forced to throw away 100-thousand dollars in revenue following last week's storm.


Good morning.
It's MONDAY, MARCH 27
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.


New developments.
This morning, Silicon Valley Bank has a new owner... and a new name.
North Carolina based "First Citizen" has purchased the bank... and customers should notice the change when branches open in just a few hours.
ABC7 News reporter Gloria Rodriguez is live in Santa Clara -- with what this change will mean for customers.
The FDIC saying that today, the 17 former branches of SVB will open as First Citizens Bank.
Silicon Valley Bank customers will automatically become customers of First Citizens.
This was announced overnight..
Raleigh-based First Citizens Bank purchasing Silicon Valley Bank.. which failed on March 10. This after depositors rushed to withdraw money amid fears about the bank's health. It was the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history.
The FDIC saying the sale.. involves the sale of all deposits and loans of SVB to First-Citizens.
Last week in a speech to the American Bankers Association, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying the Biden Administration's swift response to protect depositor savings in the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank collapses was key to fortifying the broader US banking system.


The news is already impacting the markets.
Nasdaq-traded First Citizen Banc Shares Inc jumping about 12 percent in pre-market trading today.
Shares of other banks also seeing a boost.
The FDIC said that customers of Silicon Valley Bank should continue to use their current branch until they receive notice from First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company that systems conversions have been completed to allow full-service banking at all of its other branch locations.
This week, the Federal Reserve is waiting for another key inflation report -- that measures consumer incomes and spending.
It comes as more shoppers are turning to "buy nothing" groups -- to save money and the planet.
Here's ABC News reporter Becky Worley.
Starting this morning, you may see more police when you take BART. 
The agency in increasing its police presence on trains and at stations.
BART officials are also suspending fare enforcement at Embarcadero Station on weekday mornings so that fare inspectors and officers can patrol elsewhere. 
BART is trying to prevent thefts and violence, and a fiscal crisis brought on by a decline in the number of passengers. 
The transit agency says it's survival is at risk if it doesn't increase ridership.
Silicon Valley Bank has been purchased.
The F-D-I-C made it official late last night.
The new owner is Raleigh, North Carolina based First Citizens Bank.
According to the Feds, all 17 branches of Silicon Valley Bank will re-open as First Citizens outlets.
S-V-B was once a top lender to many tech firms in Silicon Valley before it ran into trouble. 
The regulator says the purchase price was 72-billion dollars, discounted by 16-and-a-half billion.
First Citizens has been one of the biggest buyers of troubled lenders lately.  
In the East Bay, a Berkeley sandwich shop is out tens of thousands of dollars.
Last week's storm knocked out power for *four* days, causing thousands pounds of  food to spoil at "Deli-Rama."
The owner TELLS US the loses include a couple thousand pounds of brisket for its popular pastrami.
He says 20-thousand dollars of food is headed to the compost heap.
It would have netted 100-thousand dollars in sales.

 
The community is also stepping up to save the business.
At least 22-thousand dollars has been raised online to help Deli-Rama.
It will reopen Thursday when it plans to sell other sandwiches-- just not the pastrami that's made them beloved.
The National Transportation Safety Board is blaming dim lighting for the death of a BART passenger in 2021.
41-year old Amy Adams died after she was dragged by a train leaving the Powell Street station.
The newly released N-T-S-B report found that although the operator completed the required safety check, due to dim lighting, they could not see that a leash tied to Adams' backpack had become trapped in the train's door.
Those lights have since been changed for brighter ones.
An autopsy found traces of several drugs in Adams' system, but the board could not determine whether the drugs played a role in her death.
The N-T-S-B ruled the death as accidental.
After a weekend of beautiful weather, the bay area is now preparing for this next storm system that's churning toward us.
ABC7 News Reporter J.R. Stone has the story.

In the wake of the mass shooting in Tennessee ... California Attorney General Rob Bonta is appealing a ruling that struck down a California gun law.
The law requires semi-automatic handguns to have certain safety features before they're sold.
Last week, a judge blocked the law - saying it violated the Second Amendment.
Bonta is now challenging that decision at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The law was originally enacted more than two decades ago.
downed trees are a real concern because the ground is already so saturated.
Last week, five people died in the Bay Area from falling trees.
Experts say even with less wind and rain during this storm, more trees will topple in urban areas.


We spoke with a family in Martinez who just got two trees removed.
The trees were leaning on the hillside behind their house.
Power outages have started popping up around the Bay Area in the last hour.
This is PG&E's current map.
Those areas with orange squares indicate where as many as 5-thousand customers have lost electricity.
At last check almost 52-hundred customers were without power -- the majority of those in the South Bay.
We continue to follow developing news on the school shooting in Tennessee.
Authorities are still searching for a motive.
But moments ago, police said none of the victims were targeted.

She  joins us live from Walnut Creek, with more on the storm impact there...
ANOTHER dreary Tuesday of rain and wind - some stayed home. Some ventured out although this storm was a far cry from last week and the week before. 
Still, there were accidents here and there, like this midday crash on Highway 24. In orinda heavy rain. A tree down at Acalanes Ridge in Lafayette with a muddy mess on the trail.  And a totally obscured Mt. Diablo over Walnut Creek in this latest deluge. Afternoon Downpours down in Danville. Another Bay Area spring day. 
But it's not good for little league games. Practices and games cancelled. 
BUt there is good news out here amid the gloomy skies- an improving situation along Interstate 580 at the Altamont pass where last week a retaining wall collapsed, as lanes of the busy freeway developed huge cracks.
Now to the North Bay and ABC7 News Anchor Liz Kreutz.
She joins us live with a look at conditions there...
Liz...
Those tall, steel and glass structures have defined the city's skyline. But in recent weeks, with the strong wind-storms, walking pass them has become somewhat unsettling. The fear of glass falling is called nelophobia.
Today, a window on the 30th floor of the Salesforce East Building cracked, prompting the closure of Mission Street between Main and Fremont for a few hours. 
Any shattered glass still remaining on the ground today was blamed on a previous glass damage. 
In smaller neighborhoods it's the downed trees that have caused damage to property. In San Francisco's Bernal Heights, crews strategically removed some fallen branches while trying to salvage what was left.
There is concern in the city for the hundreds of trees already lost. 
Today's winds interrupted some ferry service as the waves and winds made conditions difficult.  Even when they resumed operations, crossing the bay made for a choppy ride. 
Despite months of continuous storms, some still enjoy the outdoors.

Lena...
Good morning.
It's TUESDAY, MARCH 28
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.


With more wind and rain, there are also renewed concerns over toppling trees.
For the very latest, let's go to  ABC7 News Reporter Amanda Del Castillo, who is in the east bay this morning.
It won't take much to get trees toppling today, unfortunately.
We speak a lot about how the recent rain has created such saturated soil… experts say... you add even a little wind, and we're in for some trouble.
They've explained, the taller the tree, the wider the canopy, the bigger the danger.
Last week, five people died in the Bay Area from falling trees.
Experts describe— the wind blew from a different direction than usual in *that storm.
High wind velocity and super saturated soil along with *drought stressed trees* have made for an unprecedented perfect storm for tree failure.

 
Beyond that— Urban forestry experts explain trees planted by streets are unable to grow roots under the streets themselves.
And are usually weakened if wind is coming from the street side.
We saw that firsthand in San Francisco last week— where more than 900 trees went down. Many along Sunset, Brotherhood Way, and other areas around the Bay Area.
As the storm is expected later this morning— current conditions (wind?)

He has endorsed Lee in the Senate race -- and also announced on Sunday that he will serve as Co-Chair of Lee's campaign.

 
Ro Khanna says Lee is the reason he ran for Congress.
If elected - Lee will be the only black woman in the U.S. Senate.
It has happened again.
This time - six lives cut short from the latest mass shooting in America.
An elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee.
Three of the victims -- just nine years old.
And this morning -- we have new surveillance video from police.
A warning -- it may be disturbing for some to watch.
The more than two minutes of security video shows the shooter drive up to the private school parking lot yesterday morning.
Moments later - video shows the SHOOTER shooting out the locked front doors before walking into the second floor and other areas of the Christian school and opening fire.
Jobina is tracking the latest on the investigation... and what we're learning about the victims.


another round of wind and rain hits the bay area.. 
as our storm-battered region sees even more trees come down..
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.
Luckily today's storm didn't cause as much damage as the systems we've seen in the past few weeks.
But still, we have ABC7 news team coverage.. 
With crews following the latest on downed trees in the east bay, flooding issues in the north bay..
As well as the high winds again causing concern for windows in san francisco high-rises..
And at the coast in santa cruz county.
But let's begin with ABC7 news meteorologist Sandhya Patel.. 
To the south, Santa Cruz county has been repeatedly hammered by our recent storms.
And today was no different, with the rain and intense winds hitting the region.
But that didn't stop locals and even some tourists from venturing outdoors.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes joins us live with more...
It was a pretty mild day when we're comparing things to the stroms we've seen since the start of the year but that doesn't mean the high winds and rain skipped this area.
Strong wind gusts blasted us here, that along with the rain could feel physically painful at times...many were still willing to endure it.
Santa Cruz County has been one of the areas hit over and over again by storms since the start of the year.
The areas impacted, not just limited to the County's coastal communities.
 My mom's in Watsonville. So she's had to evacuate a couple times.
In less than three months, the county saw back-to-back flooding, extreme debris on beaches and even roadways giving out.
In some of those areas, partial road closures are still in effect.
In others, like this portion of main street in Soquel that washed out weeks ago.... temporary fixes are the only things giving the residents access to the rest of their community.
County officials telling us recently that all of these new impacts are adding to an already overwhelmed to-do list of repairs they're trying to make.
 we're still recovering from 2017. we've got roads that haven't been fixed from that storm so these things are kind of layering on top of each other.
Despite all of the headaches caused by those storms, many have tried hard to not let this one get in the way of their everyday routines.
 It's nice to enjoy the rain instead of just the normal dry weather.
The big storm here as tourists like these made their way to California for a little R&R.
 you're from Utah? Was this the weather you're expecting to find in California?
 Well, this year maybe Yeah. Following all the storms all over. It's been crazy winter for us, too.
Despite the wind hitting our faces hard as we spoke, this family from Utah says the storm has... in their opinion... done nothing to ruin the county's reputation as a destination.
 I've always liked big waves. And stormy beach weather. So I'm liking it.
Still, even some who say they've enjoyed the most recent round of brutal weather say it's come with inconveniences.
Like this man who's in the process of remodeling his home.
 some out you know, our exterior work can't do anything when it's raining
And though people throughout the Bay Area were either impacted by the worst of the storms or know someone who was, many have tried to keep a spirit of positivity.
 I haven't had any repercussions from it. No trees falling on my cars, but I know a lot of people have and that's sad, but at least the reservoirs are filling up.
So again, the impacts of the storm today have been mild when put next to the more recent storms but the impacts from those are still being felt.
Santa Cruz County is in the process of gathering preliminary damage information from county residents impacted by the storms to submit a case for state and federal funding.
Live in Santa Cruz County, Zach Fuentes ABC7 news.
Of course we know that today's winds brought down even more trees.. smashing cars, and creating damage in neighborhoods..
ABC7 news reporter Ryan Curry has been chasing it all, and joins us live.. 
The storm is causing more power outages in the Bay Area.
Here's a live look at P-G-and-E's website showing the problem areas.
Nearly 29-hundred customers are without power in San Francisco.
That's nearly two-thirds of the Bay Area outages... which are less than four-thousand right now.
P-G-and-E sent a strike team of one-thousand workers to work on outages in the Santa Cruz area. 
In the north bay, the rain caused more flooding issues and landslide concerns...
ABC7 News Anchor Liz Kreutz. join us live with a look at conditions there...

In the East Bay... a Berkeley sandwich shop is out tens of thousands of dollars because of the last storm..
It knocked out power for *four* days -- causing thousands pounds of  food to spoil at "Deli-Rama."
The owner showed us around today.
Loses include a couple thousand pounds of brisket for its popular pastrami.
He says 20-thousand dollars of food is headed to the compost heap.
It would have netted 100-thousand dollars in sales.

 
The community is also stepping up to save the business.
At least 20-thousand dollars has been raised online to help Deli-Rama.
It will reopen Thursday when it plans to sell other sandwiches-- just not the pastrami that's made them beloved.
Many people are worried about *more trees coming down in Tuesday's storm.
This is a tree that fell in January in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
PG&E says crews have removed more than 13-thousand trees that have damaged infrastructure since the first atmospheric river on New Year's Eve.
Arborists tell the Chronicle that taller denser trees with denser crowns are more prone to fall.
Warning signs of a collapse include cracks around the root base...the tree starting to lean... or a new mound of soil.
The "Western Tree Failure Database" shows the most common trees to have fallen in the Bay Area are oaks, eucalyptus, cypress and Monterey Pines.
First... we check in with ABC7 weather anchor Spencer Christian who will let us know exactly how much rain we're in for... and when we can expect it.
Spencer, you say some areas could get up to three inches.
In the North Bay, it's been a race against time this weekend, to re-route a critical gas line around a landslide that's still active.

Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed has declared a local state of emergency because of this week's storms.
In the city's downtown area -- we saw boarded up windows at Millennium Tower, a week after glass fell to the street during a storm.
Glass has fallen from at least 5 San Francisco buildings in the last two weeks during high winds. 
One person we spoke with yesterday said they're changing their plans because of the wind and rain today.

 
Others we spoke with said they'll still come out to the Financial District today, since they don't have the option to work from home.
It won't take much to get trees toppling today, unfortunately.
We speak a lot about how the recent rain has created such saturated soil… experts say... you add even a little wind, and we're in for some trouble.
They've explained, the taller the tree, the wider the canopy, the bigger the danger.
Last week, five people died in the Bay Area from falling trees.
Experts describe— the wind blew from a different direction than usual in *that storm.
High wind velocity and super saturated soil along with *drought stressed trees* have made for an unprecedented perfect storm for tree failure.

 
Beyond that— Urban forestry experts explain trees planted by streets are unable to grow roots under the streets themselves.
And are usually weakened if wind is coming from the street side.
We saw that firsthand in San Francisco last week— where more than 900 trees went down. Many along Sunset, Brotherhood Way, and other areas around the Bay Area.
As the storm is expected later this morning— current conditions (wind?)

In the wake of the mass shooting in Tennessee, California Attorney General Rob  Bonta is appealing a ruling that struck down a California gun law.
The law requires semiautomatic handguns to have certain safety features before they're sold.
Last week, a judge blocked the law - saying it violated the Second Amendment.
Bonta is now challenging that decision at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
The law was originally enacted more than two decades ago.
Golden Gate Ferry says its service to Angel Island is canceled today and tomorrow because of the weather.

That's according to authorities. 
Less than two hours ago - gunfire erupted again. 
Authorities say the man walked out of the house and was a threat.
That's when an officer from an area agency opened fire. 
The suspect was wounded and has been taken to a hospital.
A sheriff's deputy was hit by a bullet that ricocheted during the gunfire. 
That deputy is in a stable condition and is expected to recover.

THIS IS STILL IN ITS VERY EARLY STAGES  AND BEFORE IT MOVES FORWARD  THE DISTRICT NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT TWO THINGS.
ONE, HOW TO PAY FOR IT AND TWO…. HOW TO STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT IT. 


THAT'S WHY THE DISTRICT HAS DEVELOPED A new 15- to 20-person Task Force… TO HELP ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND EXPLORE reparations for black descendants of enslaved people.
THIS COMES AFTER GENERATIONS OF OVER-POLICING, DISPROPORTIONATE INCARCERATION AND HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BLACK CALIFORNIANS.
If BERKELEY UNIFIED succeedS, it will be the first program to do so in this country.
The U-S has already granted reparations to Japanese-Americans and Holocaust survivors.
WHILE IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH MONEY STUDENTS IN BERKELEY COULD RECEIVE IF THIS MOVES FORWARD…. 
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS THEIR OWN REPARATIONS TASK FORCE AT WORK, LOOKING INTO THE SAME THING…. AND SO DOES THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
THE CITY'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE MOST RECENTLY RECOMMENDED FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PAYOUTS… FOR PEOPLE THAT QUALIFY.

IN TODAY'S MEETING  WHICH IS STILL GOING ON RIGHT NOW -- This first-in-the-nation task FORCE CAME TOGETHER TO HEAR FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERs.
 BOTH PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING LONG OVERDUE... AND OTHERS WHO CHALLENGE THE IDEA OF REPARATIONS PAYMENTS.
The NINE member task force has been traveling the state to learn about generational impacts around issues LIKE housing discrimination... over-policing... and segregation.
One preliminary estimate puts that cost at more than 800 billion DOLLARS… more than TWO AND A HALF times THE STATE's annual budget.
THE FIRST TWO HOURS OF TODAY'S MEETING WERE ALL PUBLIC COMMENT… CREATING A HEATED DEBATE FROM FOLKS CALLING IN ACROSS THE STATE.

 
BUT NOT EVERYONE SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF REPARATIONS PAYMENTS… MANY QUESTIONED HOW THE STATE WOULD EVEN PAY FOR IT.
And some critics have pointed to the fact California was never a slave state as the reason current taxpayers should not be responsible for damage.

 
OTHER ADVISERS TO THE TASK FORCE SAID THEY'RE ALSO WORKING ON determining eligibility, who receives compensation first  AND prescriptive analysis how to measure the harm that was done. 
THE TASK FORCE HAS until July 1st to finalize a dollar amount AND TURN THEIR final report OVER TO THE STATE.

          Donald Trump indicted by a grand jurty today-- becoming the first U.S. president ever charged with crime. 
Good Evening,  I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.
Former President Trump has been the subject of countless controversies in his political career.
But none quite like this. 
It's a headline never used for a president before.
The front page of  Friday's edition of the New York Times says it in two words--  "TRUMP INDICTED".
Here's a live nighttime look from Mar-a-Lago in Florida... where Trump and his team are absorbing the news tonight.
The specifics of what's included in the Manhattan indictment aren't yet clear.
Let's go to ABC7 News Reporter Tim Johns with what  we should expect in the days ahead. Tim.
Dan, Ama, as you can imagine the news sending shockwaves around the nation, including right here in the Bay Area. 
Throughout the evening, I've been talking with local political leaders and experts about what the former president's indictment means and where we go from here.
Sources tell ABC News that Trump has been calling Congressional allies on Capitol Hill, urging them to go on the offensive and defend him.
In the studio, Tim Johns, ABC7 News. 
 And here's a live look from Trump Tower in Manhattan.
The scene many expected to take place there--after the indictment-- has not materialized so far. 
Only a few of the presidents supporters have been spotted around the building. 
There are still all sorts of questions about how things will play out in Manhattan when the former president surrenders for his arraignment--likely next week.
There's also concern about possible threats IF Trump sits through a trial.
Experts agree, all of it is uncharted territory. 

 
The NYPD has installed "blast protection" barriers around Trump tower. 
And late today the entire department received a letter ordering all 35-thousand officers to show up for work in uniform, and to be prepared for deployment as of 7am tomorrow.

Protestors said they're waiting for more federal help.
This week the state requested a presidential disaster declaration from the White House.
Until that happens... FEMA won't be able to come help.


This is Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history. 
The Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to Get Trump,' but now they've done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant Election Interference.
Never before in our Nation's history has this been done.

Here's a look at the history of San Quentin -- the oldest prison in California.
Construction began in 1852 ... prisoners worked on building it and slept on a nearby prison ship until it was complete in 1854.
Both male and female prisoners were incarcerated there until 1933.
It has housed the state's only gas chamber and death row since 1938 ... although the last execution there was in 2006.
Governor Newsom announced a moratorium on executions in 2019 ... and in 2022, he began transferring inmates sentenced to death to other prisons. 
The death chamber at San Quentin is being dismantled.
It's a well known prison - housing a number of infamous prisoners including Charles Manson, Richard Ramirez, Sirhan Sirhan and Scott Peterson.
Two famously rehabbed former inmates are Merle Haggard and actor Danny Trejo.
Many are outraged after Governor Newsom announced his plan to transform San Quentin State Prison into a Rehabilitation Center. 
Marc Klaas - founder of the Klaas kids foundation - says the plan will not work for violent offenders.

He says Davis was formally released into society from a rehabilitation center ... and killed his daughter a few months later. 
ABC7 News Insider Phil Matier gave insight into what it would take for the plan to flop.

After all the bomb cyclines, atmospheric river, and endless storms... most of the state is now completely out of the drought, including the Bay Area.


That's the upside... but there is a downside. For Lake Tahoe, it means an extraordinary amount of snow and rain... leading to flooding, road closures, people being snowed in and collapsed buildings.

 Some good news coming from our recent drought-busting winter storms.
Our reservoirs are now surging to some of their highest levels in years.
   99-percent of the Bay Area is now drought free... as you can see in the image on the left from today's drought monitor map.

ABC7 News Reporter Cornell Barnard explains what it means for that community. 
Let's get more now on the drought and today's updated data.
ABC7 news meteorologist Sandhya Patel joins us from the roof with the details... 
The storm has cleared but the damage remains for a huge portion of the South Bay and  Penninsula.
At the height of the storm, PG&E says in Santa Clara County 140 thousand customers were without power.
Days later many are still in the dark.
The outages, virtually shutting down places like Downtown Los Altos.
 bad for business but there's nothing we can do
Residents in this  Saratoga neighborhood, like Judy  Morring, are dealing with the impacts as best as they can.
But even with a home well-equipped with lanterns and other provisions...Mooring says the steps she's taken can only go so far.
 The hard part is losing your all your food in your refrigerator, because at this point, I have to throw away a lot. Even with keeping a lot of ice in there.
PG&E says it's been working consistently to restore power to everyone as fast as possible...we got a look inside one of its service centers where an incident management team coordinates crews and other resources.
The utility company though admitting, that the storms have had them facing tough conditions.
 there were some areas that we couldn't access because of safety issues. And at one point, because we did see wind gusts that exceeded 90 miles per hour, our crews had to stand down because it wasn't safe for them to get work done.
As the work continues to fix the short term issues, the back-to-back storms have brought attention to the long-term solutions.
With wind being a main culprit in these more recent outages, we asked PG&E about the possibility of investing more into underground power lines.
Though no clear timeline or plans were given, the utility says not even underground lines have been safe from these storms.
 not only has vegetation broken, our power poles and power lines that are above ground, but flooding and landslides have caused damage to underground facilities as well.
Still PG&E says it is working with engineers, local government and other agencies to better invest in infrastructure.
For now homeowners like Mooring are just ready and waiting for their life to get back to normal.

This is part of a much bigger goal of adding 22-thousand beds across all of the nine campuses by 2028. 
As  ABC7 news senior education reporter  Lyanne Melendez tells us, some say it's not realistic.
Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan today to create 12-hundred tiny homes throughout the state.
He made that announcement today in Sacramento as part of his week-long tour of the state to announce policy goals. 
He is doing this instead of a traditional State of the State address.
San Jose will get 200 of those 12-hundred tiny homes and the rest will be disbursed in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Diego.

Newsom expects the tiny homes will be up and running by this fall.
There currently are at least 160-thousand unhoused people in California.
Tomorrow the governor's tour of the state will take him to San Quentin Prison to talk about his criminal justice plans. 
His press office says governor Newsom will provide details on plans to shift San Quentin from a maximum security facility...to a center for education and training within the prison system. 
San Quentin was once home to the nation's largest Death Row.
But four years ago, the state dismantled San Quentin's execution chamber on governor Newsom's orders.

The Wall Street Journal reports - executives at the bank sold nearly 12-million dollars in stock in the two months leading up to the crash.
First Republic sent an email to customers about the rescue package.
It says it is staying focused on "operating a simple, straightforward business model, and providing exceptional service to our clients and communities."
Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz - who is the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee - has launched an oversight investigation into what happened with Silicon Valley Bank.
Time now for first focus - where we pick a couple stories and take a closer look at them....
Today we're talking about housing near San Quentin...
And facial recognition in stores... 
We begin with housing...
A huge affordable housing project is getting built right next to San Quentin.
The new 250-unit building will go near Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, in open space next to Drake's Cove Road.
State officials and residents held a public hearing last night over the Oakland Hill Apartments.
More than half the units will go to Marin Educators and school staff.
The site is part of the county effort to meet Governor Gavin Newsom's executive order on the creation of more affordable housing.
Our other focus...
High prices may not be the only thing you have to worry about at the supermarket.
Someone may be watching you.
There is a new movement toward using facial recognition in stores for security, and it's not without controversy.

We drove by Alameda Creek.. and it is raging right now.
High wind and rain is expected this week.. which increases risk of downed trees and floods.

One of the hardest areas this morning is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, especially in Felton an area prone to flood where we get storms like this..
This is the Felton grove neighborhood along the banks of the San Lorenzo River -- as you can see it underwater.
We're told the river is receding-- it nearly hit the bottom of the landmark covered bridge. This isn't far from Roaring Camp, a popular tourist destination. 
Authorities also closed an intersection at Mount Herman and Graham Hill roads-- this is the main route into the San Lorenzo Valley from Scotts Valley.
We're checking to see if the road has been reopened.

 Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
and I'm Ama Daetz.
All of that and *more rain now moving in - but first... an emergency developing further south... a downpour disaster in Santa Barbara County.


An evacuation order covering thousands of people... the entire community of Montecito... was ordered today as pounding rains threaten to unleash mudslides.
Up to a foot of rain was expected to soak already drenched hillsides there.
Those hillsides still scarred from wildfires.
 Floodwaters swept away a 5-year-old boy.
The search for him was called off when the rising Salinas River became too dangerous for rescue divers.
Montecito is an enclave for celebrities.
Those evacuated include Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, as well as Ellen DeGeneres.


This flooding comes five years to the day mudslides in Montecito killed 23 people.
The strength of rushing mud 15 feet deep carried boulders the size of houses and damaged or destroyed 500 structures.


And the Bay Area is seeing dangerous threats of its own.
After this many days of steady storms -- the effects now becoming life or death in 
Today, Governor Newsom's office said 14 people have now been killed by the California winter storms.
The need to still be hyper-vigilant - is there.


We have team coverage for you tonight - focusing on the damage done -- and the cleanup in the days to come.
But first - let's bring in Spencer Christian because this new round of rain is already staring us down.
Happening now... This PG&E outage map shows the areas where power is out tonight.
More than 21-thousand people in the bay area... including Santa Cruz County... are in the dark as of about an hour ago.
The most outages are indicated on the map in orange.

Officers went door to door this morning to warn homeowners.
Emergency crews in Santa Cruz shut down a lane of traffic along highway one, due to a log jam in the San Lorenzo river.
A northbound lane was closed just south of River street, before noon, to make way for emergency crews to get in and remove debris.
The rain stopped this morning and waterways like the Guadalupe river have receded from their peak levels...even so...the water is still much higher than normal and rushing fast...
Even though the upcoming storms are weaker...the current water levels still have local leaders on alert.
The headaches caused by the storms seen in the last week continue.
The impact of the most recent one on early Monday morning was nearly deadly for Veronica Maul...who's unhoused and living along the Guadalupe River in San Jose.
 we heard the branches almost three hours ago trees starting to want to fall and we were like oh my god and then we'd seen the water it was super high.
Not long after, she found herself in need of help...fast.
Crews were able to rush in and save her....as the water only continued to rise....
 they helped me get out of being right there from where it was really flooding and i'm really grateful...
Her incredible rescue isn't the only that's happened in San Jose since the start of the storms.
 - our fire department engaged in a couple of pretty heroic rescues being out in the channel with fast moving waters helping two individuals get out of the guadalupe river.
Overall, officials say they started taking proactive measures at potential flood spots ahead of the storm to minimize damage.
 We've already removed sediment from about 50 various locations around the county and example is an upper penitente a creek where we had to remove a large bunch of sediment just to ensure that flooding didn't occur into the local residences.
San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan says protecting the unhoused though living along waterways...and reminding them of the evacuation order still in place in those areas...will be the city's focus.
Police continue to drive by annoucning the order and shelter information on loud speakers in multiple languages.
City leaders and non-profits also going on foot to spread the news.
Mahan says some have taken them up on their offer to relocate to a shelter run in partnership with the Red Cross.
 We currently have 99 residents and eight dogs at the center. And as soon as we reach 110 people, we will then move to open the Camden community center. So we have an additional evacuation center for those who are willing and able to come in from the elements which we highly recommend.
Despite the water rescues needed and the high creek levels....Mahan and Valley Water officials say that the work the community did ahead of the storms...may have saved lives.
 we think we averted what could have been much worse.
Mahan did say at the press conference today that they were alerted to a death on Penitencia Creek, but they still haven't gotten a coroner's report back yet to confirm how it happened.
Right now, the city says the Red Cross shelter and overnight warming shetlers will continue to stay open and expand as needed.

ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey has been monitoring the power outage in the south bay.
Dustin, what's the situation like there now?
 The rain wasn't much of a factor this morning... but the wind definitely caused issues... including with those outages like you just mentioned.
 It was a lot of the same early on today... sort of marking boxes on a storm bingo card.
The streetlights around San Jose State University were out... as were about a dozen throughout the downtown area... check that off the list.
Just down the road... a snapped tree branch brought  powerlines down with it at Third and Martha Street... another two more for the bingo card.
Neighbors listened to the wind howl before hearing a more unfamiliar noise.


 Thankfully no injuries were reported and San Jose Fire and PG&E Crews were able to get the line and road cleared quickly.
At this point a few hundred customers are still without power according to the PG&E outage map.
In San Jose Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
and we have weather team coverage with Spencer Christian, Drew Tuma and Lisa Argen.

If you haven't already done the prep work -- it might be too late.
A potentially "life-threatening" storm is moving into the Bay Area right now... flooding... downed trees... and landslides are all a real possibility today.
The rain is just arriving on the coast right now ... but in the next few hours... the roads could become quite dangerous.
If you can stay home today -- do it.
Today's storm is a 'Level 5' on our exclusive ABC7 Storm Impact Scale.
It's the first time ever a level 5 storm has been declared. 
Good morning.

We have live team coverage of the the impact... 
ABC7 News reporters Lena Howland and Gloria Rodriguez are live with the impact of the storm.

WE ARE IN THE EMMERYVILLE DRIVING THE 80 CORRIDOR TOWARDS RICHMOND WHERE BECAUSE IT'S SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND STILL PRETTY DRY OUT HERE  WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MAJOR ISSUES ON THE ROADS. 
"TAKE DRIVING SHOT" 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW A LIVE LOOK AT THE 80 COORIDOR WHERE AT THIS MOMENT, WE'RE REALLY ONLY SEEING SOME LIGHT SPRINKLES SO FAR. 
THIS IS A DIFFERENCE FROM WHERE WE STARTED FURTHER OUT IN THE EAST BAY WHERE IT HADN'T STARTED RAINING AT ALL YET. 
THIS SMALL BIT OF RAIN DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE CAUSING ANY PROBLEMS FOR DRIVERS YET  BUT THAT COULD CHANGE QUICKLY, WE'RE IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA WHERE WE SAW A JACK-KNIFED SEMI ON FRIDAY MORNING, BLOCKING ALL NORTHBOUND LANES FOR SEVERAL HOURS WHICH DIPPED INTO RUSH HOUR. 
WHEN THE RAIN REALLY STARTS COMING DOWN, MAJOR ACCIDENTS LIKE THOSE ARE LIKELY TO HAPPEN AGAIN SO DRIVERS NEED TO PAY ATTENTION AND BE PREPARED. 
TRIPLE A SAYS IF YOU DO HAVE TO BE OUT DRIVING DURING HEAVY RAIN -- SLOW DOWN, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE FROM OTHER CARS, AVOID SKIDS WHICH CAN HAPPEN FROM SUDDEN BRAKING, STICK TO THE CENTER LANES IF YOU DO SEE FLOODING ON THE SHOULDERS… AND IF YOU COME TO A TRAFFIC LIGHT THAT'S OUT  REMEMBER TO TREAT IT AS A FOUR-WAY STOP. 
"BACK TO LENA LIVE" 
AS THE RAIN IS STARTING TO PICK UP, WE WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER UPDATE ON THE CONDITIONS WE'RE SEEING OUT ON THE ROADS COMING UP IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR. 
On the Peninsula -- people are preparing for those strong winds today that could create a lot of damage.
ABC7 News reporter Gloria Rodriguez continues our team coverage live from Pacifica.
Gloria, what are you seeing out there right now?
Live at Pacifica Pier..
San Mateo County was hit pretty hard by the weekend storm..
Bellmont Creek rising out of its banks this weekend.. Flooded streets stretching from San Carlos to Redwood City.
Adam Hilderbrand says water got into his storage unit.. about 10 inches deep. 
He's preparing for the next storm.
And he's not the only one.. San Mateo County maintenance Yard running out of sandbags yesterday afternoon.
Some took their own bags and filled them with sand.


Patrick Wan's garage flooded over the weekend. He and his seven year old were getting ready for today's rain.. hoping to fill 10-15 sandbags.
San Mateo County's supervisor David Canepa says they ordered about 24,000 bags.. to be distributed to cities throughout the county
The city of San Jose has announced a local state of emergency.
New mayor "Matt Mahan" will give more information at a press conference today at 10 a-m... that we will bring to you live.
Overnight, San Jose police safely evacuated groups of unhoused residents along local creeks.
This as other cities, like Santa Cruz, have have already issued evacuation *orders with these flooding and mudslide concerns.
We'll zoom in to show you exactly where.
This order involves the northern part of Santa Cruz County -- off of Highway One -- along Whitehouse Canyon Road and Daffodil Lane.
Santa Cruz County is under a local state of emergency due to the potential for dangerous flooding and rock slides, like this one along Felton Empire Grade Road yesterday morning.
San Francisco leaders say they're ready for the storm.
But, they are warning people the rain could be too much for crews to handle because of the amount and intensity. 
That's why city agencies are suggesting people limit their 9-1-1 calls ... only for for life-threatening emergencies.


San Francisco's Emergency Operations Center will be functioning in shifts of 12 hours, which is available right now until 4 P-M tomorrow.

Let's get another check on weather with Meteorologist Drew Tuma. 
 THE STRONGEST PART OF THE MOST SEVERE STORM EVER RANKED ON THE EXCLUSIVE ABC7 NEWS STORM IMPACT SCALE is hitting the bay area right now.
Now to the South Bay and  ABC7 News REporter  Zach Fuentes... where there's concern about some of the most vulnerable people.
Zack has a look at efforts to keep the unhoused safe during the storm.
Zach?


The focus by local officials and nonprofits continues to be on the waterways and the   unhoused people living along them.
Work has been done since early this morning to evacuate them and get them to safety.
At least one local nonprofit has been   brining a shuttle bus around to waters along places like Coyote Creek,   Pnenatancia Creek and Guadalupe River to bring them to shelter.
City of San Jose Mayor Matt   Mahan said this morning that there are more than 2000 beds for   unhoused to shelter in.
  VTA is offering free rides and people can bring what they can carry.
Police, city officials and volunteers have been walking up and down the water ways trying to urge people to   evacuacuate.




Though the  evacuation orders are mandatory, for now San Jose police say they  will not be forcefully evacuating  anyone.
And that if it gets to the point where it is a life safety issue...it will be difficult for them to even get to people.
So the goal right now is to try and get as many people out now while there is an opportunity.
Live in San Jose,  Zach Fuentes  ABC7 news.
Now to Alameda County .. people there are seeing the effects of the wet and windy weather.

If you're not prepared for the storm yet, right now is the time to get ready.
Fill sandbags and get your car to higher ground, especially if you live in an area known for flooding.
Also, clean up your yard.
You don't want anything left out that can be picked up by high winds and potentially hurt someone or break your windows.
Inside your home, close blinds and curtains in case your windows shatter.
And document what you own - with pictures.

This comes as fans and supporters gathered for a candlelight vigil last night outside of University of Cincinnati hospital.
Pray for Hamlin signs and posters were scatted around the group wishing for Damar's full recovery.

Good evening. We are on El Caiptan Drive in Danville. On Saturday ... this neighborhood was flooded with 3 to 4 feet of water. We have watched crews clean up these over the past few days. They look much better. But there is still a lot of thick mud on the streets. The concern now  how will neighborhoods like this one  which are still saturated from Saturday's storm hold up against Wednesday's downpour. 

 
Over the past few days I have spoken to city and county officials  as well as police and fire. They one message they keep repeating  is not to drive through standing water. There is likely going to be a lot of flooding. You don't know how deep it is or what's in the water. They don't want people to get stuck or lose control of their cars. 
Back to you.

We're hearing from a family spokesperson this morning who says Hamlin is "sedated" right now-- after that frightening on-field collapse during Monday Night Football.
We've made the decision not to show the play, but Hamlin tackled a Bengal's player-- stood up-- and then collapsed on his back moments later.
The first assumption was conussion but looking at the reaction of his teammates-- it was became immediatley clear that this was more serious.
Hamlin received C-P-R on the field.
The Bills released a statement saying he suffered "cardiac arrest" and that Hamlin's heartbeat was restored on the field.
Of course, there are questions as to what led to the collapse.
ABC News Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton is talking about it on Good Morning America.


Hamlin's mother was looking from the stands when her son collapsed.
A family spokesperson gave an update this morning.

 
Hamlin is 24 years old.
He's in his 2nd year in the NFL.
No word yet on when the game will be rescheduled.

Happening today -- 
The Department of Water Resources will be taking their first snow survey of the year, at The Phillips Station snow course in South Lake Tahoe.
Every month the agency measures the water content at over 260 snow courses across the Sierra Nevada.
The numbers help give an idea of what the states water supply is going to look like --- Specially in hotter months.
So far, state officials say the Sierra is receiving its snowiest start to the season in about a decade.
But they also warn, that the snowy trend is not guaranteed. 
After the game was called off fans of both the Bills and Bengals showed their support.
Some gathered outside University Hospital in Cincinnati where Hamlin was receiving care...
hoping and praying for his recovery.
The most recent post on Hamlin's Instagram account is him hosting his 3rd annual toy drive.
He posted this video of himself with children on Christmas.
But here's just a note of how much people are jumping in to do something in a time like this.
In the time since Hamlin collapsed, people on social media started sharing this link to a toy drive Hamlin started back in 2020.
The original goal was just 25-hundred dollars.
But it has since surpassed 3-million dollars.
With the risk of more flooding and damage so high -- crews in San Francisco are already preparing for the next storm.
Crews were out yesterday using an industrial sized vacuum to clean out catch basins.
Those are used to collect and drain water during a storm.

 
Workers at the Everlane Clothing building on Folsom Street were busy last night trying to get the building cleaned up after flood waters poured in.
They hope to get sand bags in place before tomorrow.
San Francisco Public Works had to put their sand bag site on hold last night -- due to high demand.
They hope to reopen it soon.
Many people who suffered flooding in their homes -- will now be dealing with their insurance companies.
7 On Your Side's Michael Finney has a look at what damage will be covered by insurance and what damage won't. 
((Let's start with your homeowners.
Most policies cover wind damage to your home and that includes a tree that falls.
With water it gets tricky, but here is the basic rule -- if water falls it is covered, if water rises it is not…. Unless you have flood insurance.
So if your basement floods, your homeowners policy will probably not pay. If your roof is damaged and rain gets in, you are most likely covered.
Mold damage gets very complicated, check your policy.
Flooded cars are covered, but only if the owner carries comprehensive coverage.
It is the same with a falling tree. If you have comprehensive, you are most likely covered.
Most newer cars have comprehensive coverage because finance companies require it for an auto loan.))
I'M MICHAEL FINNEY, 7 ON YOUR SIDE.
The Sacramento area is also preparing for more flooding this week -- after disastrous flooding over the weekend.
Rescue crews have been plucking stranded drivers from their cars.
This is the end of a dramatic situation yesterday in South Sacramento County. 
Crews made it to a woman stuck in a partially submerged vehicle. 
By the time she made it to dry land she had a clear message for her rescuers... and other drivers.


This is a reminder that if you come across a flooded road -- you should *not drive into the water. 
A portion of Marsh Creek Road is closed after a mudslide in Brentwood.
Marsh Creek will be closed between "Morgan Territory" and "Round Valley" as crews work to clear the area.
People are advised to use alternate routes. 
Residents are allowed to pass through the area.
It's unclear when the road will reopen.
In Contra Costa County...
Residents there are also filling up sandbags ahead of tomorrow's storm.

Joining us live now to talk more about that and other health headlines is ABC7 News Special Correspondent Dr. Alok Patel.
**Dr. Patel, I think many of us were shocked to learn Damar Hamlin he suffered a cardiac arrest. He's only 24…and being in the NFL probably one of the fittest people in pro sports. It's now being reported that something called "commotio cordis" could have played a role. What is that?
**Something you noticed…a lot of discussion on social media about athletes going into sudden cardiac arrest. Has there been an increase…or is this something that's just taking off because of Twitter.
**Some inspiring aftermath of Hamlin's incident are coming out. Right after his cardiac arrest, donations to his GoFundMe toy drive skyrocketed…it's now at over 7-MILLION dollars! But from a medical standpoint…the American Heart Association is seeing a spike in those wanting to learn CPR! Dr. Patel this is a life-saving technique that it seems like more people should know how to do!
**Now let's shift gears a bit. COVID, flu, RSV. Seems like a lot of people are still sick. Are we seeing a post-holiday surge?
**This week, the FDA granted accelerated approval of a new drug to fight Alzheimer's. What do we know about this one? How is it different from others on the market?
**Another big headline this week ... retail pharmacies can now offer the abortion pill. Is this development a game-changer?

We have live team coverage of the the impact... 
Let's begin with Meteorologist Drew Tuma...
Let's bring in an old friend and a familiar face...
Former ABC7 news reporter Matt Keller - he now is with the santa clara valley water district... Hello!
*How is everything looking right now?
*What are you all doing to prepare for the 2nd wave this afternoon?
*What are you expecting to happen?
*What can we do right now to prepare?
*It's a double-edged sword... because we need this rain... we're told it won't dramatically change the drought but how will this impact water in the south bay?
Its one of the topics on everyone's minds this morning -- What are the driving conditions like and how can we prevent accidents on the roads right now?
Officer David La Rock with the  California Highway Patrol in Redwood City joined us earlier this morning on abc7 news at 6am and shared some tips on how to stay safe during this strong level five storm.
Earlier... We talked about how this storm is impacting the south bay now let's head to the north bay...  
Joining us live from Santa Rosa Fire... is Paul Lowenthal - the division chief fire marshal... good morning..
*What are you seeing right now?
*How is santa rosa fire prepared?
*We are waiting for the most dangerous part of this storm... what can people still do to prepare?
*You all have been through a lot when it comes to the weather... what impact are you expecting when it comes to burn scars and previous fires?
*What do you do if you start seeing water coming into your home?
*What spots are you most concerned about?
*Is there anything else viewers can do to make sure they are prepared?


IF YOU HAVEN'T GUESSED BY NOW... you are being urged to stay home if you can.
Officials are predicting widespread flooding, downed trees, and dangerous conditions on the roads.
But if you absolutely must go out ... the C-H-P has some advice on staying safe.


Officer Barclay also says it's extremely important to slow down.
The C-H-P says speeding is the number one cause of crashes during storms.
And another reminder -- never, ever drive through standing water.
You have no way of knowing how deep it is ... places where you've driven safely before could be compromised.
Remember, it doesn't take much to get your car stuck.




There is an expected lull in the storm early this afternoon - that may be a good time to Fill sandbags and get your car to higher ground, especially if you live in an area known for flooding.
Also, clean up your yard.
You don't want anything left out that can be picked up by high winds and potentially hurt someone or break your windows.
Inside your home, close blinds and curtains in case your windows shatter.
And document what you own - with pictures.


It's also a good idea to locate your gas service shutoff valve and electric panel ... so you know where to go if there is an emergency.
Also unplug your electronics.




We are getting ready for a news update on air... but first We want to show you A LIVE LOOK OUTSIDE...

Some are nervous after last weekend's storm that soaked the bay area.

 
Clean up efforts are still underway even as this next storm fast approaching.
Officials are advising people to stay indoors if possible with a flood advisory now in effect for all bay area counties.
It's a big question as we get more rain...
How much have the recent storms impacted our state's drought and water supply?
The first snowpack survey of the year was held in South Lake Tahoe yesterday.
Officials say it's at 177 percent of normal.
They said we're off to one of the "snowiest" starts in about 40 years.
But, the recent storms still aren't enough to end drought conditions. 


To get a sense of the overall snowpack level...
State water officials take measurements at more than 260 locations across the Sierra.
This is to forecast the amount of snow that will melt and flow into our rivers and reservoirs.
Looking north to the Sierra...
This storm is expected to dump 8 to 14 inches of snow in the area... with wind gusts up to 40 miles per hour in the Tahoe Basin.
That's on top of the already 3 feet of snow they saw this weekend.
If you're heading that way -- you should be prepared for chains on both HIghway 50 and Interstate 80.

He believes a clogged parking lot above the property contributed to the flooding.
Karraker says crews built a trough ""  troff""to catch any rain that may come through the wall again.
It's a temporary fix.
He really hopes it works.
He says the biggest issue right now... is not knowing when the gym will reopen.
As we've been saying all morning -- it could be very dangerous to drive today.

Sandbags have been at a premium as people prepared for this storm.
This was the scene in Oakland where crews gave out free sandbags at the Drainage Services Facility yesterday.
Others in the Bay Area might not have been so lucky with multiple towns running out.
San Francisco says it's preparing to have more this morning.
We've been putting running updates with all of that information on this article -- right on the front page of our website.
From sandbag locations to traffic and evacuation notices... it's at  abc7 news dot com.
Today's level five storm has the potential to disrupt bedrock and sediment, leading to mudslides and sinkholes.
We've already seen some of the damage from last weeks storm -- for example at the Oakland zoo.
And now residents who've experienced previous slides in their neighborhoods say, they're worried about the safety of their homes.
A Sausalito resident describes the moment nearly 4 years ago, when a massive mudslide took down her neighbor's home.


And in the East Bay City of San Pablo, a mudslide in 2011 forced homes to be red tagged and yellow tagged.
Years later the problem was fixed but residents who live in the area have seen gradual shifting of power poles and cracks in the street --- 
They say no storm has yet tested the fix.
The city of San Jose has announced a local state of emergency.
New mayor "Matt  Mahan" will give more information at a press conference today at 10 a-m... that we will bring to you live.
Overnight, San Jose police safely evacuated groups of  unhoused residents along local creeks.
This as other cities, like Santa Cruz, have have already issued evacuation *orders with these flooding and mudslide concerns.
This order involves the northern part of Santa Cruz County -- off of Highway One -- along  Whitehouse Canyon Road and Daffodil Lane.
Santa Cruz County is under a local state of emergency due to the potential for dangerous flooding and rock slides, like this one along  Felton Empire Grade Road yesterday morning.
It's a big question as we get more rain...
How much have the recent storms impacted our state's drought and water supply?
The first snowpack survey of the year was held in South Lake Tahoe yesterday.
Officials say it's at 177 percent of normal.
They said we're off to one of the "snowiest" starts in about 40 years.
But, the recent storms still aren't enough to end drought conditions. 


To get a sense of the overall snowpack level...
State water officials take measurements at more than 260 locations across the Sierra
Looking north to the Sierra...
This storm is expected to dump 8 to 14 inches of snow in the area... with wind gusts up to 40 miles per hour in the Tahoe Basin.
That's on top of the already 3 feet of snow they saw this weekend.
If you're heading that way -- you should be prepared for chains on both HIghway 50 and Interstate 80.
A winter storm warning will go into effect at  7am. 
As we close out our sixth hour of continuous coverage... We want to show you some of our live cameras right now so you can see conditions across the bay area...




In the East Bay we're already starting to see some damage starting to form
Two tree have fallen down in walnut creek.
One of them blocking the west bound lanes on Pleasant Hill Road

The two trees are from the same hillside, but they fell in different directions.
We want to make sure we cover all of our counties and talk to officials to see how they are prepared....

The National Archives confirms the documents were turned over the next day.
ABC News has confirmed the Justice Department has launched an investigation into what happened.
While this seems similar to the investigation into classified documents kept at former President Trump's home in Florida.. 
The White House underscoring the documents were *not the subject of a National Archives' request... 
which makes this very different.


President Biden was asked about the discovery last night in Mexico City -- but he did not comment.
Sources tells ABC News, Attorney General Merrick Garland is assigning US attorney John  Lausch to head this review.
The Trump appointee will investigate the chain of possession of the classified documents.

A disaster is developing in Santa Barbara County this morning.


An evacuation order is in effect for thousands of people - covering the entire community of Montecito.
Pounding rains threaten to unleash mudslides.
Up to a foot of rain was expected to soak already drenched hillsides there.
Those hillsides still scarred from wildfires.
Floodwaters swept away a 5-year-old boy.
The search for him was called off when the rising Salinas River became too dangerous for rescue divers.
Montecito is an enclave for celebrities.
Those evacuated include Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, as well as Ellen DeGeneres.


This flooding comes five years after mudslides in Montecito killed 23 people.
The strength of rushing mud 15 feet deep carried boulders the size of houses and damaged or destroyed 500 structures.
In the Santa Cruz mountains - southbound lanes of highway 17 have reopened after a mudslide at Glenwood Drive.
And take a look at this...
PG&E posted this video captured by a line worker of a huge pine tree along Highway 9 - just north of Santa Cruz.

We have reporters from the south bay to the north bay...
Let's begin with Spencer Christian and the forecast...
Take a look at this PG&E outage map -- thousands still without power, with the bulk of those outages centered in the south bay.
The latest report from PGE shows over 114-thousand customers without power, nearly 63-thousand of those customers in the south bay and central coast.
((The town of Felton has been pummeled with rain over the last week and a half with two major floods storming through the area.
But yesterday was definitely the worst.
We'll go live now to ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey who is in Felton with how things look today.
Dustin?
We're here in Felton Grove near the Covered Bridge County Park.
If you look over my shoulder... things look a little damp... but nothing too bad.
But that was not the story yesterday when the San Lorenzo River came up to a near record 24.52 feet high.))
From one day to the next... a town underwater... became a town under mud.
The Felton Grove neighborhood now a swampy mess after a flashflood ripped through early Monday morning.
And about as fast as it went up... it went down... leaving a waterstained reminder of just how bad this flooding was. 
1982 was the worst storm these residents have seen... and they said 2017 brought a major flood as well.
But yesterday stands as the second highest the San Lorenzo River has ever risen.
Less surprising for these neighbors is what comes next... 
The clean-up.
Most of these homes are raised... leaving damage limited to many residents' garages and lower levels.
Enjoying a bit of reprieve from the storm... the neighbors hope the bad weather will subside soon enough. 
It has been almost constant rain since 2023 began... residents have had to evacuate twice due to major flooding.
Jokes aside... despite really devastating weather... the people of Felton push on.
Thankful everyone is okay considering... they count their blessings with each push of a broom or scoop of a shovel.
Positivity knowing that the storms will pass and blue skies will return again.
In Felton Dustin Dorsey ABC7 eyewitness news.
((Really incredible to see the positivity on the street.
The neighbors say they truly come together in times like this... it's uplifting to see the spirit come out despite the circumstances.

This spot has seen some of the most extensive damage, all of it a big shock and hassel to the people who live and work nearby.
Again PG&E says it will be days before they can get the lines back up and running that bring power to these homes and businesses specifically.
As for Anthony who owns the Auto Shop, he says he got in touch with his insurance  comany and says it's looking like most of his damages will be covered.
For now, he and others around here are looking forward to having power again.

 It was a wild and bumpy ride for a few hours in San Francisco as the wind, heavy rain, lightning and even hail caused trees to topple and more flooding.  
ABC7 news reporter Lyanne Melendez was out there and joins us live...
One needed to see it to believe it.  A MUNI bus crushed by a tree on Sutter near Stockton in downtown San Francisco.  For Sam Mohareb, the owner of this black SUV, it was a terrifying moment when the tree also took down power lines while he was still inside the car. 
No one inside the MUNI bus was injured. 
Shortly after, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for San Francisco, Daly City and South San Francisco. 
Five minutes later, a hail storm covered the city. With it came lightening... dozens of strikes across the city.
Including on iconic Sutro tower... captured from far away... and up close.
 The heavy downpour caused more floodings around the city  making it dangerous for cars to be on city streets.
Within minutes of us being there, Public Works managed to clear the blocked storm drain.  Here's some of the debris they collected all morning. 
But the fallen trees continue to be the city's main issue.  Since New Year's Eve Public works have responded to about one-thousand downed trees and branches.  Today alone 14.
This morning crews worked quickly worked on removing this Black wood Acacia which fell on a car.  The owner was not inside at the time. 
Drew Landers has worked for Public Works for years and says this is as bad as it gets.
The town of  Felton has been pummeled with rain over the last week and a half -- with two major floods in the area.

High winds pushed the tree into some power lines and onto two vehicles.
There were two people inside one of those cars. 


The people stayed inside their car until crews turned off power to the live wire that was on their vehicle.
Staying in their vehicle most likely saved their lives. 
LIGHTNING STRUCK THE TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID TODAY.

RELENTLESS RAIN PUTTING THE BAY AREA IN A NON-STOP STATE OF EMERGENCY.
WE'RE ALL ASKING IT -- IS THERE AN END?
BECAUSE THE DAMAGE IN OUR STREETS AND TOWNS IS PILING UP.
Good Evening,  I'm  Dan Ashley.
and I'm Ama Daetz.
There's no doubt about it now.
This is a storm season we'll be remembering for quite a long time.
The endless California winter weather is just one of the stories topping tonight's "news to know".


So there we find tonight's "Deep Dive".
It's an issue that's making news - but worth exploring how it could affect you.
This is one that could happen to any of us.
A quick trip to the E-R.
In this case - real quick.
Just 100 yards for "Amber Chan's" ambulance ride to the health clinic next door.
But guess the price tag...
A charge of $2,255.
If you lay it out...
That means Chan was forced to shell out more than 20 bucks for every yard she went.
But tonight -- our ABC7 I-team is arming you with tips to know to dodge these surprise bills.
Our Stephanie Sierra has this.
It's the talk of the Bay Area tonight -- and we have been hearing what you are saying.
Tonight's trend...
Of course the incredible images and recordings showing the wild weather.
I posted them on my instagram and facebook pages - and hundreds of you reached out with comments and more videos.


It got going right away...
That was what "Ashley Marrs" sent us from the Tenderloin...
           Hours later she dealt with more hail....gotta feel for her. Wow...the sound of that hail really gets you.
Then check out this tweet from the account "at san andreas fault"... saying "U ok at sutro tower".
That is something you don't see everyday. Sutro Tower feeling the brunt of the power there. 
And even Drew Tuma got involved - replying to "Karl the Fog" on Twitter...
Drew wrote....so were not going to talk about August 202 when lightning decided to light the entire Bay Area on Fire.
        Love Drew but he sure did get serious with Twitter account Karl the Fog there....Bill commented Drew versus Karl. I'm torn.....I'd take Drew seeing that we don't even know who runs the Karl the Fog account.
It's our central focus every day we bring you the news here on ABC7.
In what ways can we all try and build a Better Bay Area?
Well tonight - we are finding a few of those breakthroughs.
Our first is some progress that we have been covering over the past 3 weeks.
It starts with a single mother in Richmond - living in an R-V with her teenager.
We had then learned 5 days ago... the mayor of Richmond recently found them housing and paid for one year of their rent.
After our story aired - "Brianni Peters" was trying to fundraise to then *furnish her home.
And tonight - we made sure to be there for *another act of generosity.

 
The non-profit "Make a Home Bay Area" told us they would furnish Brianni and her daughter's entire place for free.
So now they are getting moved in.
By the way - that non-profit "Make a Home Bay Area" is furnishing homes for at least 5 other families right now.
Our second breakthrough is focused on how you get in and out of San Francisco... and how that might be changing.
Today our team learned that the city is planning on making you leave at least 20 feet of space in front of a city bus when you park.
It means some parking spaces will go away... to help people with mobility or accessibility issues.
But others have said it will make it even *harder to find open spaces coming into or driving around the city.
We'll be sure to keep an eye on where the city goes with this for you.
This next breakthrough - is one where we were inspired to see people working to create change.
We just had to bring you their story.
One group -- using music to create change... by bringing music education into the lives of children in San Rafael's Canal neighborhood.  

 
This program called "Enriching Lives through Music" is completely free.
It's in the Canal neighborhood of San Rafael.
Kids get ten hours of music lessons a week.
If you had to put a price tag on this level of music education, it would be close to seven-thousand dollars per student. 
And in addition, the older students get high school and college counseling.
It started with 15 students 13 years ago.
Now, it has 150 kids and three orchestras. 
If you know someone working to build a better bay area, tell us about them at   abc7news dot com slash take action.
This other trending story gets an immediate reaction no matter who you are.
It has exploded this week right after it was tweeted.
This shop owner in San Francisco hosing down a homeless person sitting outside.
The man said he has tried asking this person to move more than two dozen times and hasn't found a solution.
Some outraged with him,
ABC 7 Mornings Anchor Reggie Aqui said this...
"There's really no both sides to this. We don't use hoses on people. Period."
Great point Reggie but others of you chimed in...saying the city isn't doing their part to help here.
Many of you took to our ABC 7 News Instagram page... here's another take from commenter "shilohish"...
He essentially says the city of San Francisco doesn't do much to help business owners or residents quote "exasperated by the homeless problem".
"Shilohish" does say this doesn't excuse the man's behavior... but only he knows what he put up with and that the city needs to be cleaned up period.
         I'll keep my coments to myself on that one but
Keep your comments coming - find me on Facebook or Instagram "at j-r stone live". 
And our full account... "ABC 7 Bay Area".
OK.
Stephanie Sierra is here with us now.
We've all heard of pricey hospital bills - but this is a new level.
So what kind of charges should we be on high-alert for?
""STEPHANIE""
HOSPITALS OFTEN BILL WHAT'S CALLED OUT OF NETWORK' CHARGES. THESE ARE SERVICES THAT MAY BE DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE PRICE - BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY YOUR INSURANCE. BUT CAN BE CHALLENGED.
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA TO AVOID SOME OF THESE SITUATIONS.

LET'S KEY IN ON THAT. 
WHAT'S BEING DONE TO HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS NOW?
""STEPHANIE""
A NEW LAW JUST WENT INTO EFFECT THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS FROM GETTING OVERCHARGED WITH HUGE BILLS FROM AIR AMBULANCES. 
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAD AN EMERGENCY ON THE SLOPES OR GOT CAUGHT IN A SEVERE STORM THAT REQUIRES AN AIR AMBULANCE FOR TRANSPORT-- THIS LAW PROHIBITS CALIFORNIANS FROM GETTING STUCK WITH THE ENTIRE BILL. 
WHEREAS BEFORE, CONSUMERS WOULD OFTEN HAVE TO PAY IN FULL, WITH ADDED OUT OF NETWORK COSTS.
 ""DAN""
MEDICAL BILLS CAN BE TOUGH TO DECIPHER. WHAT OTHER RESOURCES ARE OUT THERE?
""STEPH""
For low income families who are uninsured, not on Medicaid or Medicare -- There are some charities  like Healthwell Foundation- that may help pay for some or all of an ambulance bill. For low income families who are uninsured, not on Medicaid or Medicare -- There are some charities  like Healthwell Foundation- that may help pay for some or all of an ambulance bill
ANOTHER OPTION -- medical bill negotiators. Recent studies show they have up to an 80% success rate. AND USUALLY CHARGE 25% OF WHATEVER SAVINGS THEY GET YOU.

President Biden says they don't know the cause ... but will find out.
The last ground stop was around 9/11 ... initiated by Norm Mineta, who was from the Bay Area.
ABC7 News Reporter Gloria Rodriguez joins us live at SFO with the impact there.
SFO has had some cancellations and delays.. but a spokesperson tells me it's unclear if they were related to this morning's ground stop..
It's also pretty early.. so we'll see if there is a ripple effect on flights throughout the day.
Some passengers tell me their flights were impacted.
The FAA saying flights had been able to land safely.. and it was only impacting flights that were taking off.
FAA is investigating the cause.
 Check your flight to see if there are any delays.

Politico reporter Jeremy White will talk about that.
But first... we remain on storm watch.
We're getting more rain and windy conditions today. 
Joining us live now is ABC7 weather anchor Spencer Christian, with the very latest.
Now to the battle to over the U.S. Senate seat held for the last 3 decades by 89-year old Dianne Feinstein.
Although the oldest person serving in the Senate right now has not officially announced she will call it career after this term ends, it is certainly widely expected that she will not run for another 6-year term next year.
And now, a source close to East Bay Congresswoman Barbara Lee tells ABC7 she's told her fellow Democratic colleagues that she is running for that seat.
Joining us live now to discuss this and the other big California political story today, the climate change battle may be taking a big hit under Governor Newsom's budget cuts... Politico reporter and author of the California Playbook, Jeremy White.
**Let's start with Oakland Congresswoman Barbara Lee... she didn't formally announce anything today... but a source close to her has confirmed to us that she's told her colleagues... any surprises here?
**Any idea if she's gotten Feinstein's blessing? It's clear Socal Congresswoman Katie Porter didn't, when she announced officially yesterday.

**The other big story... Governor Newsom announced his budget, which will include drastic cuts due to the huge deficit from an ailing tech sector and loss of tax revenue... which areas will be the biggest losers? climate and transit. 
**which areas will he preserve? school lunches and transitional Kindergarten. What does that say about who he thinks holds the key to any national ambitions he might have?
**will newsom be criticized for cutting climate, especially after he opposed prop 30, the ballot tax to fund clean cars, and it did get defeated?

It's been non stop work for PG&E crews....working around the clock to fix this transmission tower brought down by a eucalyptus tree.

Like other business owners we've spoken with since Tuesday...his operations and customers continued to be impacted with each moment the power had been out.
 can't even pay my vendors when they come out I can't even print out checks or I mean nothing where you know, there's nothing it's our shop is a dungeon.
When the 137 foot tower came down Tuesday...it yanked other power distribution poles like this one that landed on the roof of a restaurant and this one that's seen on the ground in front of this apartment complex....damage that also left hundreds of residents without power for two days.
 my daughter had to spend the night at her friend's house because she can't shower in the dark. And she needs her phone. And so I mean it's really quiet and peaceful, very dark. But it's frustrating.
PG&E says they've had both local crews and workers from out of state fixing the damage here and throughout the Bay Area.
 We have a large team that's here helping us rebuild the transmission tower. And it's happening very quickly. These are experts that are cutting piece by piece to rebuild the tower that was damaged.
Despite the impacts most of the businesses and homeowners have faced some have worked to stay positive. 
 i can't live without power but i like the dark. Q. but you'll be happy to have your power back? Yes, yes,
PG&E says the outage caused by this tower falling could have been incredibly severe.
A lot of customers here in the South Bay rely on power that comes from this fallen transmission tower but they were able to redirect electricty to most of them....it's been the more than 2000 in this area that were most impacted because of the direct lines the transmission tower ripped apart when it collapsed.
The number of people impacted has since gone down to more than 700....restoration is expected by tonight.

THIS IS WHERE STRONG WINDS CAUSED A GIANT EUCALYPTUS TREE TO FALL YESTERDAY  AND IT TOOK DOWN THIS ENTIRE TRANSMISSION TOWER WITH IT  WHICH USED TO STAND NEARLY 140 FEET TALL…. KNOCKING OUT POWER TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS WAKING UP IN THE DARK BECAUSE OF THIS TODAY.

He says he knew before coming to work that the power was out at his business.. but he didn't expect the scene he found… WHICH FORCED HIM TO CANCEL ALL OF HIS APPOINTMENTS FOR THE DAY.


PG&E leaders on scene said the tree that fell was right next to the river  and once it fell, it created a domino effect, first taking down the transmission tower and the tower took down two more power poles.
I JUST CHECKED THE P-G-AND-E OUTAGE MAP AND IT APPEARS THAT POWER IS STILL OUT IN THIS AREA FOR MORE THAN 300 CUSTOMERS… CAUSED BY THIS EQUIPMENT ISSUE/

THIS IS WHERE STRONG WINDS CAUSED A GIANT EUCALYPTUS TREE TO FALL YESTERDAY  AND IT TOOK DOWN THIS ENTIRE TRANSMISSION TOWER WITH IT  WHICH USED TO STAND NEARLY 140 FEET TALL…. KNOCKING OUT POWER TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS WAKING UP IN THE DARK BECAUSE OF THIS TODAY.
The downed tower and the damage it's caused, leaving businesses unable to take in customers.
Anthony  Gueco owns Alvin's Auto Center along Lincoln Avenue in San Jose...the businesses right in the middle of the most extensive damage...the transmission tower that collapsed just behind his building....and next door the restaurant that now has a power pole buried in its roof.
He says he knew before coming to work that the power was out at his business.. but he didn't expect the scene he found… WHICH FORCED HIM TO CANCEL ALL OF HIS APPOINTMENTS FOR THE DAY.


PG&E leaders on scene said the tree that fell was right next to the river  and once it fell, it created a domino effect, first taking down the transmission tower and the tower took down two more power poles.
I JUST CHECKED THE P-G-AND-E OUTAGE MAP AND IT APPEARS THAT POWER IS STILL OUT IN THIS AREA FOR MORE THAN 300 CUSTOMERS… CAUSED BY THIS EQUIPMENT ISSUE/
AND THEY SAY POWER ISN'T EXPECTED TO BE RESTORED FOR THIS AREA UNTIL AFTER  11PM.
LIVE IN SAN JOSE, LENA  HOWLAND,  ABC7 NEWS.
On the peninsula, dozens of people are out of their apartment complex and waking up some place else... after the rain and wind ripped part of their roof off. 
It happened early yesterday morning on Susie Way in South San Francisco... just as we were seeing intense rain and wind.
Most people in the building have had extensive damage to their units and belongings because of the recent storms. 
i

 
Water is still seeping from their ceilings... destroying carpets and flooring. 
Authorities have deemed the entire building uninhabitable. 
This leaves residents with thousands of dollars in potential lost property and without a home. 
Some who live in the complex have set up a  GoFundMe as they try to figure out their next move.
In the Santa Cruz mountains, many Felton residents are cleaning up a muddy mess.
Parts of the town were under water when the San Lorenzo River swelled to nearly 25-feet high.
That's eight feet over the flood stage.
It nearly matched a record set 40 years ago.
Water poured into homes, leaving behind water stains.
One homeowner says the amount of damage from the flood was unexpected.

 
Most of these homes are raised - which limited damage to residents' garages and lower levels.
There are no reports of any injuries.

When life gives you lemons... you make lemonade.
When life gives you a rushing creek... I guess you fish.
The Uvas Creek in Gilroy crashing up along the road into Christmas Hill Park... just a few days after it swelled up flooding much of the area.
So much water that the farm lands on the outskirts of the city remain completely saturated.

The home is now accessible... but roads remain closed along some of the streets in the area due to continued flooding.
Even though this area had been forecast to flood... no one expected this.
A message we've heard a lot across the Bay Area recently.
Valley Water tells us the Uvas Reservoir continues to spill over.
Residents nearby the creek will still see high water levels and need to be prepared for localized flooding with rainy conditions continuing into next week.
But thankfully... we shouldn't see a repeat of Monday anytime soon.
((Valley Water announced today that they have extended the Emergency Flood Declaration so they can continue to respond to the potential for flooding in Santa Clara County as the rain continues.
In Gilroy Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
In the Dog Patch neighborhood of San Francisco this huge tree managed to crush a parked van. One of the limbs then threatened to fall on the MUNI light rail high-power lines.
Crews were able to secure the limbs before cutting some of the branches off. 
As anticipated by Public Works, trees continued to fall due to the saturated soil. 
On Hyde Street near Lombard, this ficus tree was previously tagged to be removed. But part of it came down on this house and on the sidewalk. Again, crews quickly removed it.
In the Russian Hill neighborhood the soil underneath this walkway slowly began washing away. Crews had to use buckets to remove the mud on that hill.

**you see a big economic cost to our recent storms, bomb cyclones, atmospheric rivers?
**can you put a price tag to the recent storms and the losses associated with them?
**your website has a great visual of the globe... and it shows the losses the world has sustained from natural catastrophes... walk us through it.
**from an economic perspective, which are the costliest types of disasters?
**do you expect these costs to mount as a result of climate change?
**who are the biggest losers? any winners? by state, by country, by industry.
**more deluges and wildfires for CA... main financial implications? how to minimize cost?
**what problems might materialize that could affect productivity and the global economy?
**Moody's Analytics provides financial analysis software and services... why do we need this information?
**so what's the conclusion in terms of climate investments?

The flood warning underway right now for people living in Monterey county.
Good afternoon
I'm Larry  Beil...
And I'm Kristen  Sze...
We're drying out a bit today ... but more rain is on the way.
We have team coverage as we gear up for another round of storms.
Let's begin our coverage with ABC7 News Meteorologist Sandhya Patel.
P-G-and-E has made progress restoring power outages around the Bay Area.
There were more than 10-thousand customers affected this morning.. mostly in the South Bay..
P-G-and-E's outage map reports just under 5-thousand outages remaining in Santa Clara. 
Hundreds of customers are still affected in both Campbell and near Boulder Creek in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Take a look at this video from Sky7..  A massive sinkhole has closed a stretch of Highway 92.. a major artery in and out of Half Moon Bay.
92 was shut down in both directions at about 3 AM.. from Highway 35 to Pilarcitos Creek Road.
It is the same area that was originally closed yesterday because of a 12-inch-wide dip.. which turned into the sinkhole.
Flood concerns are growing this evening along the banks of the Salinas River in Monterey County.
Officials expect the river to hit flood stage around 11 o'clock tonight.
The areas of particular concern are the farming communities of  Chualar "" choo- lar"", and Spreckles.
They're urging residents to heed evacuation orders already in place, or be prepared to get out at a moment's notice.


 Sheriff Nieto seemed to play down the threat of the Monterey Peninsula getting cut off by flooding -- saying only that drivers can "potentially" expect disruptions along highway one.
That would be in the areas near Marina and Carmel Valley.
There's been incredible flooding in the South Bay ... and more wet weather will return this weekend.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey joins us live with tips on how Santa Clara County residents can prepare for the rain.
Yes, us reporters do own more clothes than just rain jackets and hats... it's nice to have blue skies overhead. But they won't last long.
And if you look over my shoulder here... our rivers are high and there's a lot of debris running down them.
The flood risk remains high... and leaders want you to be safe if it happens.
Even with blue skies overhead... the minds of leaders in Santa Clara County remain on the storm.
That means more rain, clogged drains, wet roads and even a risk of flooding... especially along our rivers and creeks.
Valley Water extended their emergency flood declaration this week... and they are using today's dry weather to prepare for what's to come... and leaders encourage you to do the same.
Santa Clara County wants you to know what to expect and when as it relates to these weather disasters... and that's where their SCC Alerts come in.
More than a million residents have already signed up for call, text and email messages specifically for you and where you live.
166 thousand texts and 462 calls have been sent out over our recent winter storms.
That includes when the Uvas Creek began to flood in Gilroy.
Alerts were sent out so families could make quick decisions in a dangerous situation.
It only takes minutes to sign up... and the county believes those minutes can make all the difference.
It's really easy to sign up... I did so today. Alert-  SCC- dot-org is the website.
Take advantage of a break in the rain, and be ready with alerts to come.
Live in San Jose Dustin Dorsey  ABC7 News.

Jobina -- we're now learning more about what caused the outage ... and how much longer the delays could last?
One of those deaths includes a woman in the North Bay who was found dead in her car after floodwaters surrounded it.
43-year-old Daphne Fontino of Ukiah called 911 on Tuesday. 
She said she was trapped in her car off Trenton-Healdsburg Road in Forestville.
Rescue crews started searching and tried to call her back, with no answer. 
Divers found her yesterday morning.

 
In Sebastopol, one driver said the heavy rain made his car skid off of the road on Highway 12.
And in Novato, a tree came down on this playground.
There are far less delays and cancellations today.
But, the Allied Pilots Association says the issues could last into tomorrow. 
The F-A-A now says a computer engineer mistakenly replaced one file with another during a software update.
That caused a ripple effect that ended up bringing down the NOTAM "" note-am "" or 'notice to air missions system' on Tuesday.
The NOTAM gives safety information to pilots before take off. 
A back up system kicked in and things seemed normal...
But ongoing issues overnight prompted the nationwide ground stop for departing flights early yesterday morning. 
It was lifted in just two hours -- but it was too late -- delays had already begun for thousands of travelers. 


The FAA says there is no evidence of a cyber attack. 
Congress is pledging it will investigate the computer malfunction.
This incident comes less than a month after that Southwest Airlines meltdown that led to mass cancellations over the holidays.
Across the state, at least 19 people have died in the recent storms.
At least four of those deadly incidents have been here in the Bay Area.
Trees around the Bay Area are falling due to high wind gusts and soil that has become over saturated.
In San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood - the large tree you see here fell on top of a parked car.
Some of the branches came close to taking out Muni's light rail lines.
Crews were able to secure the limbs before it could impact transit routes.
The fire department is advising residents to call 3-1-1 to report downed trees and power lines.
In the South Bay...
Parts of Gilroy are now submerged and roads remain closed because of flooding.
Just a few days ago - Uvas Creek swelled and flooded nearby areas including the home of the original Garlic Festival.
Farmlands close to the creek are still saturated with water.


Santa Clara Valley Water says residents living close to Uvas Creek should prepare for more flooding through next week.
Evacuation orders are in effect for Monterey residents.
It comes as the Salinas River continues to rise from intense rain.
According to The Monterey Sheriff's Office, the flooding could turn Monterey Peninsula into an island.
Evacuation zones include North of Highway 68 to the Pacific Ocean.
Authorities say people in the area must leave immediately.

 
Temporary evacuation points and emergency shelters are available.
Authorities are asking for people to leave quickly and calmly - and to check in with neighbors.
With all this rain, the state's snowpack is looking good.
The National Weather Service says California is at 102 percent of the average for April 1st.
That's the typical date of the peak snowpack.
Recent snowstorms in the Sierra and an early start to the season certainly have helped.
California is now 226-percent of average for this date.
That's higher than the recorded snowpack of 19-82 through 19-83 in all three sections of the Sierra.

Two people were rescued from their electrified vehicle... after a large tree fell on top of the car in San Francisco this afternoon.
It happened on Fulton Street between 19th and 20th avenues.
High winds pushed the tree into some power lines and onto two vehicles -- saturated soil has weakened many trees.
One of those cars was occupied.
The people stayed inside until crews turned off power to the live that was on their vehicle... if they had tried to get out it would have been very dangerous.
Lyanne, what can you tell us about the city crews working to cleanup the mess?


The force of the storm, also felt in oakland... where a brief but powerful storm pelted areas with hail... as lightning illuminated the sky.

New this morning.
 In a 4 to 2 vote, the San Francisco Police Commission has approved a controversial measure to ban so-called " pretextual" traffic stops.
That's when officers pull people over for minor infractions like expired registration tags as a way to look for other possible criminal activity.
Supporters of the ban point to data that shows the stops cost significant police time and money and rarely prevent crime.
The stops also disproportionately target people of color.
The two commissioners who voted no last night -- say they wanted more feedback from the community and to change some language that was included in the proposal.
will it be 1995 all over again?
 the warning going out now about the possible flooding that could cut off access to monterey.

in 2015 just 26 ghost guns were seized in California.
By 2021 -- that number had increased to more than 12-thousand.
In other parts of the Bay Area reservoirs are also filling up.
Officials in Marin County say all seven of their reservoirs are at or near capacity after recent storms.

 
We're not out of the drought though.
Statewide, reservoirs are still below normal levels.
Experts say we'd need constant rain through the year to make a dent in our current drought conditions.
There is concern this morning that roads leading to and from the Monterey Peninsula could be flooded out -- trapping people in surrounding areas.

Now to Santa Cruz County where the focus is on recovery and the reopening of businesses. 
Even with more rain ahead, many in the hardest hit coastal towns are asking visitors to come, shop and support. 
ABC7 News Reporter Amanda del Castillo has our story from Capitola Village.
The Salinas River crested earlier today in Monterey County after hitting flood stage last night.
There were fears the flooding could cutoff the Monterey Peninsula and turn it into an island.
That has not happened.
However, in neighboring San Luis Obispo County, the health department there says 300-thousand gallons of sewage were released into the river on Monday.
The health department says the sewage had been treated before overflowing into the river.
In the North Bay...Muir Woods will open late tomorrow at 10 AM because of the storm coming in.

A massive sinkhole... is causing a major headache for thousands of residents living along the San Mateo County coast.
Part of Highway 92 - a main thoroughfare.... is shut down from Highway 35 through Main street in Half Moon Bay. 
As storms continue to pose as a threat... it could take an hour for people to reach the nearest hospital.


San Mateo County says Life flight will remain on standby... but will deploy if it is safe for first responders.
It is unclear at this time .. when the highway will reopen.
In the South Bay...there are new evacuation warnings for Santa Clara County.
Some areas include the Uvas Reservoir, Pacheco Pass River Basin, and Highway 101 near Bolsa Road.
Heavy flooding, mudslides, high winds, and other storm dangers are expected.
Evacuation warnings are NOT orders--so people aren't required to leave, but SHOULD be ready to go.
The North Bay has been getting absolutely soaked and today all the rain took its toll... resulting in multiple mudslides.
There was one in Lagunitas and another in Fairfax that forced people to evacuate from an apartment building.
ABC7 news reporter Tim Johns was in Marin County tonight where they are preparing for what could be a rough weekend. 
Also in Santa Clara County, part of Mines Road has collapsed and is closed to the Alameda County line.

But first, we are on back on Stormwatch today.
Another wet, windy system moved through today... and though it's moving out... we still have the chance for thunderstorms.
Plus, strong wind and rain returns tomorrow.
Let's get right to ABC7 News meteorologist Sandhya Patel for a look at the forecast.
The part couple of weeks have been the most active the folks at the national Weather Service have seen in years, as it pertains to the Bay Area and Northern California.
What are the implications of that...
Joining us live now to discuss what's happening is National Weather Service eteorologist Brian Garcia
**our meterologist Sandhya Patel just told ust we have another system tomorrow... and of course, more next week... can you talk about the flooding threat... I think folks along the Salinas River are hoping the worst is over after some farm lands have been flooded... but is it? Too soon to relax?
**What about the Russian River? Threat from streams and creeks even if the next few storms pack less precipitation?
**What about the Sierra? Winter storm warning... we know we shouldn't try to drive... but what are the most pressinig threats there? 
**Is there such as a thing as too much snow when we're eager to build up the snowpack after several lean years?
**Why has it been so extraordinarily wet with one atmospheric river after another? warmer climate?
**We've had 6 powerful storms since Christmas... why is it boom or bust like this?
**Most of California is now in moderate drought... much better than extreme drought that most areas faced just one month ago. But much of the precip that's fallen won't be stored for summer use... due to how our dams and reservoirs are set up... what's the optimal way to line up our storms and receive our yearly water needs?
**Does the longer term pattern change after next Thursday? Dry pattern?
You can always track the storms on the ABC7 Bay Area streaming app.

Good afternoon
I'm Larry Beil.
And I'm Kristen Sze.
We've got live team coverage around the Bay Area as this latest round of storms moves in.
Today is a level 2 on our exclusive ABC7 Storm Impact Scale -- and a stronger storm is right behind it.
Let's get to ABC7 News meteorologist Sandhya Patel for a first look at the forecast.
In the North Bay, the series of ongoing storms has unleashed more downed trees and mudslides, one of which has left more than a dozen people displaced in Marin County. 
ABC7 News Reporter Cornell Barnard is live in Fairfax with the latest.
Right now Santa Clara County's emergency operations center is at its highest activation this weekend....so they continue to be prepared for the worst.
They are urging people to not underestimate the impacts of the upcoming storm but also the impacts left behind from the previous ones.
Though it took a brief break....the rain has returned....and more storms with it.
The last week saw the South Bay take on brutal damage....
This PG&E transmission tower....taken down by a fallen tree, cut power to thousands at one point.
First responders were seen rescuing community members most at risk along Santa Clara County's main creeks.
But while repairs are well underway on the tower and as outreach continues at encampments at waterways like the Guadalupe River...
Officials are ready for another round.
 crews, as you're well aware, are working around the clock for the past few weeks to remove debris and other blockages from those portions of creeks and streams throughout Santa Clara County
An emergency order has been extended throughout the county to provide necessary resources.
Valley Water chair John Varela says nearly 52 thousand homes and businesses in Santa Clara County are within the FEMA special flood hazard area.
County officials say the circumstances are challenging, but they're ready for the worst.
 This season. We've been coordinating all year through hot weather and cold weather. So we got plenty of practice throughout the last 12 months.
But they say it's also up to community members to stay ready not just for themselves but looking out for neighbors too.
 law enforcement officers aren't walking around everywhere. firefighters aren't walking around everywhere. Paramedics aren't walking around everywhere, but community members are walking around everywhere. So if if the community is prepared to help each other, then we're much more resilient and better prepared to face disasters as a as a community.
County shelters are going to be open throughout San Jose and other parts of Santa Clara County in case any evacuations are necessary.
But as officials hope for the best, they're fast to point out....the situation is dynamic.
 This is a unique situation. I think it was back in July perhaps August, when Noah had predicted that this rain season was not going to happen that we were going to be in another drought year. So we don't know when these atmospheric storms line up. They just you know they they hit us and they hit us hard.
Officials are urging everyone to sign up for your local alert system...here in Santa Clara County that's SCC Alerts.
The other big reminders are to make sure you make an emergency plan with family and friends and have an emergency supply kit.
Live in San Jose, Zach Fuentes ABC7 news.
As the storms continue to hammer the Bay Area, the number of blood donations is dangerously low with many of the regular donors staying put at home. 
Even here, the blood supply has gone from a 4 day reserve to a one day on hand supply .
Vatalant which has a new center next to the Stonestown Mall in San Francisco, also reported a 50 percent drop in blood drives sponsored by local businesses.
Despite today's weather, James Ogden drove from Alameda to make it to his regular appointment.
Cal O-E-S and federal officials are warning Californians to not become complacent with more storms on the way.
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell is touring the damage in the state today and tomorrow.
She says President Biden wants her to make sure California has the resources it needs for responding to those impacted by the storms.

 
Criswell says FEMA has received Governor Newsom's request for a major disaster declaration.. and will review it as quickly as possible.
A major disaster declaration recognizes the state suffered damage that requires resources beyond what most local governments can provide.. and is crucial for sending federal disaster aid.
Damage assessments are expected to surpass $1 billion.
Concerns remain high in Monterey county, as flood waters rise that threaten to cut off roads to the peninsula.

Good morning.
It's Friday, January 13th.
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.


Developing news this morning.
An investigation is underway after an East Palo Alto officer was shot.
It happened just after 11 last night near Fordham Street and Purdue Avenue.
That's where ABC7 News reporter Lena Howland joins us live.
Lena - you just got an update from police on the officer's condition?

 
WE'VE LEARNED THE OFFICER THAT WAS SHOT OVERNIGHT  A FIVE-YEAR VETERAN OF THE DEPARTMENT 
 IS EXPECTED TO BE OK AFTER BEING SHOT IN THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY. 
HE'S GETTING TREATMENT FOR WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CALLING A NON-LIFE THREATENING INJURY NOW. 
THIS STARTED AS A TRAFFIC STOP FOR A VEHICLE CODE VIOLATION ON A DARK-COLORED DODGE CHARGER JUST AFTER 11 O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT.  
THE DRIVER OF THE CHARGER FLED THE SCENE  
AND OFFICERS CHASED THE SUSPECT ON FOOT ALONG FORDHAM STREET. 
BUT AS OFFICERS WERE STRUGGLING TO GET THE SUSPECT INTO CUSTODY  HE FIRED A GUN ONCE  HITTING ONE OFFICER. 
OTHER OFFICERS ON SCENE WERE STILL ABLE TO GET HIM INTO CUSTODY AND EAST PALO ALTO POLICE SAY NO SHOTS WERE FIRED BY THEIR OFFICERS. 
THEY SAY THE SUSPECT  44-YEAR-OLD WILLIE WILEY  WAS USING A "GHOST GUN" CONVERTED TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC WITH A HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE. 
AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING  GHOST GUNS HAVE BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE ACROSS THE BAY AREA OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS…. 

 
TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE ISSUE -- 
ACCORDING TO THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL  IN 2015 
 CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SEIZED A TOTAL OF 26 GHOST GUNS. 
BUT BY 2021  THAT NUMBER HAS INCREASED TO 12-THOUSAND-THREE-HUNDRED-AND-88. 

 
THIS IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION… BUT INTERIM POLICE CHIEF JEFF LIU SAID  
THIS IS A STARK REMINDER OF THE DANGER POLICE OFFICERS FACE  AND THE ONGOING DANGERS OF GUN VIOLENCE. 
live at the EAST PALO ALTO POLICE DEPARTMENT, LENA HOWLAND, ABC7 NEWS.
President Biden and his administration insist they are fully cooperating with the investigation. 
Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Robert Hur to over see the case.
Hur is the former Maryland U-S Attorney and was a Trump appointee.
Chicago U-S attorney John Lausch "" lau-shh"", who is also a Trump Appointee, will launch a preliminary review. 
Sources tell ABC News at least 10 documents, some with top secret details on foreign countries, were found in the President's garage. 


The findings are being compared to the uncovering of classified documents at Former President Trump's Mar-A-Lago home. 
Trump called Biden's case a "disgraceful situation" in an interview overnight.
The White House says this case is different because Biden accidentally misplaced the documents.
And, the President turned them over right after they were found -- unlike Trump -- who was accused of trying to hide documents at his home.
To developing news in the investigation of President Biden's handling of classified documents. 
A special counsel is now on the case after the second batch of documents were found in the Mister Biden's Delaware home.
Jobina, how is President Biden responding after those papers were found? 
If you're traveling to Tahoe for the weekend -- you should leave right now.
Snow is expected to pick back up today through the Martin Luther King Holiday weekend.

The Oakland Zoo says it will stay closed through the rest of the month while crews work to repair a massive sinkhole.
That's weeks later than originally planned.
In a tweet, the zoo says it doesn't expect to open until early February.
Originally, it hoped to reopen by January 17th.
The new year's eve storm resulted in a 10-foot wide sinkhole that's blocking the road to the zoo's main entrance.
Employees are using a back road for now to care for the animals and say they're all safe and doing well.


A funnel was spotted off the Sonoma County coast earlier this week.
The person who shared this video was out for a hike with a friend at the time.
Since it is over water, it's a waterspout and they tend to be much weaker than tornadoes which move over land.
New details about two men found dead inside a home in Sea Ranch in Sonoma County.
Investigators say it appears they died from carbon monoxide poisoning.
A generator was found in the hallway with the power switched turned on and fuel tank empty.
The men were found in separate rooms inside the house by a crew hired to remove a tree that had fallen on the house.
We are hearing from the husband of a woman who died in the flooding from Tuesday's storm in Sonoma County.
43-year-old Daphne Fontino of Ukiah was driving to work when she got stuck in high flood waters.
The dispatcher tried calling back, but no one answered.
Rescue crews immediately started a search for her.
A dive team found Daphne in her car the next day - which was submerged in roughly 8-feet of water.
Her husband is overwhelmed with emotion and devastation.

 
Daphne leaves behind three children, who range in age from 10 to 14.
A GoFundMe page has been set up to help her family with funeral costs.
Relief for some drivers in the East Bay.
Crews have reopened Highway 84 through Niles Canyon in Fremont.
Caltrans closed the road earlier this week after a massive mudslide blocked the highway. 
Crews had time to repair guardrails and address flooding along Alameda Creek.
Before you hit the road, keep in mind recent storms have caused massive pothole problems across the Bay Area.
Crews are being called out to help drivers in about every city. 
We spoke to one woman who was lucky to have made it home after her car hit a pothole on the way to Daly City. 
This was off the exit ramp of I-280 near San Jose Avenue and Mission Street. 

 
In the first 12 days of 20-23,  Caltrans says it received nearly 400 reports of potholes.
Last year they received just 9 reports for the *entire month of January.
If you hit a pothole -- you can be compensated for the damage.
We have information on how to file a claim at ABC7 News dot com.
Storm Watch now...
and the positive signs from all the rain we've been seeing at our local reservoirs.
In the East Bay and South Bay -- reservoirs are rising.
And in Marin -- officials say all seven reservoirs in the county are at or near capacity.

 
We're not out of the drought though.
Statewide, reservoirs are still below normal levels.
Experts say we'd need constant rain through the year to make a dent in our current drought conditions.


Fire alarm bells rang in Petaluma after a carport right below people's homes burned overnight.
This was on Graylawn Avenue.  
Firefighters are seen trying to put out that fire as it rose to the patios... right in front of people's doors.
You can see from the video at least five cars were engulfed. 
No word on if there were any injuries or what may have started the fire. 
The windy, wet weather continues... with flood advisories in effect for parts of the bay area.
Tonight we are tracking the power outages, clean-up efforts, and when you can expect a break in the rain.
Good Evening, I'm Ama Daetz.
 And I'm Dan Ashley.
As the rain continues we have ABC7 news team coverage.
Suzanne Phan is tracking the deadly flooding in the north bay, Zach Fuentes is monitoring power outages in the south bay... and Dustin Dorsey has an update on the clean-up efforts in Gilroy.
 But we begin with ABC7 news meteorologist, Sandhya Patel for the very latest on the conditions.. 
According to officials, the woman died when her car was stuck in flood waters.
ABC7 news reporter Suzanne Phan joins us live from Sonoma COunty with the details... and more on the dangerous road conditions in the north bay.
 In the South Bay ... power outages have been brutal.
Hundreds of homeowners and businesses have been in the dark for two days due to a collapsed transmission tower.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes is live at the site of the damage and has the latest on the progress PG&E crews have made.
We're here at Christmas Hill Park that remains closed as the  Uvas Creek continues to rush through this low-lying area.
You can see how fast this water is moving.
Thankfully the clean-up was minimal around town despite what some called one of the worst floods the city has seen.
Valley Water announced today that they have extended the Emergency Flood Declaration so they can continue to respond to the potential for flooding in Santa Clara County as the rain continues.
In  Gilroy Dustin Dorsey  ABC7 News.
 P-G-and-E crews have been busy all day responding to outages.
RIght now, there are nearly 16-thousand customers in the dark.
 A majority of them., about 13-thousand., are in the South Bay.
As you can see from the utility's outage map, the hardest hit locations include San Jose, Campbell, and the Santa Cruz Mountains.
 Across California the death toll related to the recent storms is now up to at least 19 people.
Four of those deadly incidents have been here in the bay area.
 And that includes the death of one woman who was found  today in Sonoma County.
Farther south, many parts of Gilroy are still under water-  days after Highway 101 was shut down for hours because of major flooding from the  Uvas Creek.
 ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey is live in  Gilroy  tonight. 
Dustin- how are people there doing?


  Tonight, a new reason to worry in Monterey County -- where officials are watching the water rise in the Salinas River. Now expected to crest tonight...
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.
The fear is that with more rain on the way... the worst case scenarios mean flooding could create road closures... leaving entire communities cut-off.
 So for the very latest on when that next storm will arrive, let's begin with ABC7 news meteorologist, Sandhya Patel.
New developments now.. in the plan to close several Oakland public schools.
Just last night the newly elected Oakland Unified School Board voted to rescind the planned closure of five schools.  
As you may recall the district's financial shortfall initially prompted the district to begin closing and merging schools.  
So, ABC7 news senior education reporter Lyanne Melendez is in the newsroom with the question everyone is asking, where's the money?
At least three of the newly elected board members campaigned on the promise that they would reject the school closures. They wasted no time. As you will in this report, they voted without even having a fiscal impact analysis. 
Some people are saying that would be the equivalent of buying a house and then seeing if they can afford it. But again, four of the board members insist the school district will not be a financial crisis. In fact, they reminded me that the district was certified as have a positive budget for the time time in 20 year and they ran with that.  
Can this vote be overturned? 
So remember when it comes to anything financial, it has to be approved by the trustee. That's because the district continues to be in partial receivership. The trustee is the only person who can say, 'Nope, I don't think keeping those schools open is a good idea from a financial stand point' But I am told that the trustee has never used that power to overturn a decision when it comes to their finances. 
With more rain in the forecast, and a flood watch already issued for the bay area this weekend, leaders in the south bay want everyone to be prepared..
And as ABC7 news reporter Dustin Dorsey explains- that means signing up for emergency alerts from the county.
Even with blue skies overhead... the minds of leaders in Santa Clara County remain on the storm.
That means more rain, clogged drains, wet roads and even a risk of flooding... especially along our rivers and creeks.
Valley Water extended their emergency flood declaration this week... and they are using today's dry weather to prepare for what's to come... and leaders encourage you to do the same.
Santa Clara County wants you to know what to expect and when as it relates to these weather disasters... and that's where their SCC Alerts come in.
More than a million residents have already signed up for call, text and email messages specifically for you and where you live.
166 thousand texts and 462 calls have been sent out over our recent winter storms.
That includes when the Uvas Creek began to flood in Gilroy.
Alerts were sent out so families could make quick decisions in a dangerous situation.
It only takes minutes to sign up... and the county believes those minutes can make all the difference.
It's really easy to sign up... I did so today. Alert-  SCC- dot-org is the website.
Take advantage of a break in the rain, and be ready with alerts to come.
Live in San Jose Dustin Dorsey  ABC7 News.
Many people in Monterey County remember the last time the area was sacked by severe flooding. 
This is video from 1995 from our abc7 news archives.
Back then the Salinas River flooding crested more than 7 feet above flood stage... TOPPING OUT ABOVE 30 feet.
Of course it cause major road closures on highways 68 and 156.. as well as highway 1...
Communities all along the salinas river were flooded.
In Sonoma County, the husband of the woman who died in the floods is talking about what happened tonight,.
 43-year-old Daphne Fontino from Ukiah was on her way to work on Tuesday when flooding from the storms left her stranded in her car.
She called  9-1-1 asking for help, but the call dropped.
The dispatcher tried to call her back, but didn't get through- so  rescue crews immediately started the search..
A dive team  found Daphne in her car the next day--which was submerged in at least 8-feet of water. .
 Her husband, of course, is devasted..

 
Daphne leaves behind three children.-  ages 10 to 14.. 
A GoFundMe page has been set up to help her family with final expenses.
From sky7 you can see just how swollen the Salinas River is.. and why evacuation warnings are already in effect.
Monterey County officials issued this map... showing the evacuated areas shaded in red and yellow...
As well as where emergency road closures are located.
Officials seemed to play down the threat of the Monterey Peninsula getting completely cut off by flooding... but as you can see on this map... those red "x's" mark where potential road closures could occur... would mean that towns like pacific grove, monterey, and carmel-by-the sea... would be inaccessible from the rest of the county.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes is in Monterey County with the latest.
With more storms in the forecast don't forget you can always track the weather on the ABC7 Bay Area streaming app.

First let's check your  forecast.
Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.
We are hearing from the husband of a woman who died in the flooding from Tuesday's storm in  Sonoma County.
43-year-old Daphne  Fontino of  Ukiah was driving to work when she got stuck in high flood waters.
The dispatcher tried calling back, but no one answered.

There is concern this morning that roads leading to and from the Monterey Peninsula could be flooded out -- trapping people in surrounding areas.
Video from "drone view seven" shows the SALINAS RIVER has OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS, SOUTH OF SALINAS.
WE SHOT THIS VIDEO ALONG RIVER ROAD... BY "CHUALAR ""chew-lar"" RIVER ROAD."
Caltrans closed THE CHUALAR ""chew-lar"" RIVER BRIDGE BECAUSE THE WATER LEVEL IS SO HIGH.
This map helps explain it.
The shaded parts show areas of evacuation warnings and orders.
They run right along the salinas river.
There are already some road closures in effect - marked with red triangles.
If conditions get worse.. roads into places like monterey could become inaccessible.
The Monterey County town of Spreckles is one of the areas officials are most concerned about.
The conditions of the river are constantly changing.
For now, locals continue to hold out hope.


The county has set up shelters for evacuees and local hotels are offering discounted rooms.
Officials are expecting potential flood stage activity through at least Sunday.

Though it took a brief break....the rain has returned....and more storms with it.
The last week saw the South Bay take on brutal damage....
This PG&E transmission tower....taken down by a fallen tree, cut power to thousands at one point.
First  responders were seen rescuing community members most at risk along Santa Clara County's main creeks.
But while repairs are well underway on the tower and as outreach continues at encampments at waterways like the Guadalupe River...
Officials are ready for another round.
 crews, as you're well aware, are working around the clock for the past few weeks to remove debris and other blockages from those portions of creeks and streams throughout Santa Clara County
An emergency order has been extended throughout the county to provide necessary resources.
Valley Water chair John  Varela says nearly 52 thousand homes and businesses in Santa Clara County are within the  FEMA special flood hazard area.
County officials say the circumstances are challenging, but they're ready for the worst.
 This season. We've been coordinating all year through hot weather and cold weather. So we got plenty of practice throughout the last 12 months.
But they say it's also up to community members to stay ready not just for themselves but looking out for neighbors too.
 law enforcement officers aren't walking around everywhere. firefighters aren't walking around everywhere. Paramedics aren't walking around everywhere, but community members are walking around everywhere. So if if the community is prepared to help each other, then we're much more resilient and better prepared to face disasters as a as a community.
County shelters are going to be open throughout San Jose and other parts of Santa Clara County in case any evacuations are necessary.
But as officials hope for the best, they're fast to point out....the situation is dynamic.
 This is a unique situation. I think it was back in July perhaps August, when Noah had predicted that this rain season was not going to happen that we were going to be in another drought year. So we don't know when these atmospheric storms line up. They just you know they they hit us and they hit us hard.
In the North Bay, the series of ongoing storms has unleashed more downed trees and mudslides, one of which has left more than a dozen people in marin county in need of a new place to sleep tonight.
ABC7 News Reporter Cornell Barnard is live in Fairfax with the story.

From storms to sun.
At long last - the Bay Area has a string of clear days in sight.
But signs of damage are still left over - and some danger spots are not done yet.
Good Evening,  I'm Ama Daetz.
and I'm Dan Ashley.
We will get a full look at our storm damage *still rocking the region...
But first - new word on a wild ambulance joy ride across the Bay Area.
The San Francisco Fire Department says the ambulance was stolen just before 7 tonight in the area of 47th and Irving.
Paramedics were bringing a patient to the rig when suddenly, it took off.
The driver led C-H-P on a chase through San Mateo and Alameda counties ... and ended up ditching the ambulance in Oakland.
The patient and medics were not hurt.
the suspect got away.
So let's turn to Spencer Christian now.
Because even though we are *mostly in the clear from this rain...
There's still one more blip out there...
The new monument to Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King - receiving criticism tonight.
A king family relative that lives in the Bay Area -- gives their opinion.
Plus -- the price of eggs -- skyrocketing.
That's if you can find them.
The reason... and one Bay Area store that has them -- and cheap.


New tonight -- Highway One just north of Point Reyes Station is now *closed because of a damaged road.
For the latest information on all of these road closures across the Bay Area - head to our website.
The front page has this running you can check anytime at ABC7 News dot com.
Back now to our storm watch coverage.
Multiple homes in the Berkeley Hills are under threat of mudslide.
You see the block in danger here... the area is just below Lake Anza and the Tilden Merry-go-round.
ABC7 News Reporter J.R. Stone is hearing the tension from neighbors tonight.
To the Peninsula now...
A stretch of Highway One in Pacifica is back open tonight.
A rockslide sent a large boulder tumbling into the road earlier today.
ABC7 News reporter Gloria Rodriguez shared this up-close video you see next to me.
You can see just how large of a rock is clogging the road.
Southbound lanes near Devil's Slide were blocked for several hours.
C-H-P called for heavy equipment to be brought in to remove the boulder.
All lanes are now back open.
Take a look at this..
A huge oak tree came crashing down in the backyard of a San Mateo family.
They say it seemed to fall in slow motion on Saturday afternoon.
The homeowner believes the tree's roots were weakened by a creek that raged from all of the rain.
The storm damage is *still widespread -- blocking chances to get out and enjoy those local parks again.
San Jose's popular Alum Rock Park is one of those *closed for some time.
This evening, park rangers took ABC7 News Reporter Amanda  del Castillo on a tour of the "oldest municipal park" in California. 
She has our details on the devastation and what needs to be done to reopen.
Alum Rock Park in San Jose-- "closed due to hazardous conditions."
Park Rangers took us on a guided tour Monday, to get a closer look at the damage caused by the rapid collection of storms to hit since New Year's Eve.
Park Ranger Brian Shively describes the park as a "box canyon"--
Where its sides are very steep.
Gravity alone causing objects to slide down *even in *dry conditions.
Among the list of impacts to the 728-acre park-- erosion, road hazards, and rocks along popular trails.  
Even the temporary, Hollywood-style Alum Rock sign that celebrated the park's 150 years 20-22 is no more.
Shively acknowledges there is much to do before the park reopens to the public--
Including having rangers hike every trail to assess unknown damage, potentially having to clear narrow trails by hand, or bringing in heavy equipment to do the job.
For *that damage--
Shively says an engineer will have to come out to determine the best way to either resolve the issue, or reroute traffic. 
Since the New Year's Eve closure, he says rangers are seeing about 100 visitors coming up to the entrance, only to be turned around.
While crews were hard at work assessing and cleaning up the storm damage...
Many people in the Bay Area were just happy to finally see some sun.
ABC7 News reporter Tim Johns has those emotions after a long month of rain.
From rockslides ... to mudslides ... to pavement giving way ... there's no doubt this atmospheric river has taken a toll on our roads.
And now we know just *how much.
There have been more than 500 landslides statewide since December 30th.
 That's according to the California Geological Survey, which shared this map.
As you can see in blue, there's been a cluster of landslides in the Bay Area.
So why is California prone to this?
Geologists say it's because the state has relatively young mountains.
That means much of the steep terrain is still in motion -- and covered in loose rocks and soil that can easily slide away.
Today our Sky7 also got a bird's eye view of a separate mudslide in the Berkeley Hills.
You can see that trail of mud spilling down that hillside and into the street.
Crews have parts of Claremont Avenue and Alvarado Road shut down to clear the road of that debris.
The totality of these California storms is now prompting president  biden to visit the state this week.
the white house just released his travel plans today.
the president is expected to visit the central coast on thursday to see some of the storm damage firsthand.
The president's federal emergency relief from last week has now expanded to assist 41 of  california's 58 counties... including every one in the bay area.

ABC7 New Reporter  Anser  Hassan traveled around much the Bay Area...to bring you this story. 
In Berkeley...  part of  Clairmont avenue near Tanglewood was shut down earlier today due to downed power lines.

**do you expect our drought will end after this season? what does it take?
**how are our reservoirs doing? major ones? small ones? 
**how much of the rain we're getting is just runoff and not helping us? as in can't capture or later use it?
**how can our water capture and storage system be improved and capacity expanded? 
**snowpack? healthy, but could that mean record runoff? could that pose its own danger?
**how long will the dry period last? all of january? how far can you see?

We have been posting information on road closures and other alerts on our website.
The front page has a list of live updates that you can check in on at ABC7 News dot com.
We head to the East Bay now... and new dangers due to the stormy weather.
ABC7 News reporter Leslie Brinkley spoke with homeowners in Berkeley dealing with serious mudslide damage.
Leslie?
 Marjorie Cruz says her husband woke her up early this morning to tell her they had to get out as a wall of mud pushed into their living room. 
They escaped with their dog. The home is now red-tagged as emergency crews went door to door to warn other nearby residents to evacuate in the Park Hills neighborhood which is on a steep east facing slope near tilden park. The red and white rocks mark the movement of the mud hour by hour.
 Officials fear the mud could keep moving downhill.
Nearby UC Berkeley sent out warning emails to some students about another minor mudslide on the Clark Kerr campus.
As the reservoirs throughout Santa Clara County fill up, waterways like this one continue to swell.
Crews have been working to clear debris and blockage throughout the county but one of the most important jobs for those who manage the local waterways will be to draw down the reservoirs to stop the spilling.
Right now, though...the communities who live around the reservoirs are amazed at being able to look at their favorite spots in ways they haven't seen in years.
The views and the sounds are breathtaking....
Reservoirs and creeks  throughout Santa Clara County at levels that are nearly unfamiliar to longtime residents.
 I just can't remember the last time, you know, period about that. I saw this. And so that's why it's such an epic and exciting time.
The water at Lexington reservoir goes on nearly as far as the eye can see....spilling over, creating waterfalls that are drawing in incredible crowds.
  It's been so dry that this is exciting.
This group of rowers...who call the reservoir a second home...telling me their favorite activity will now be a lot easier to do...
 it's great, because now we don't have to carry the boats down very far. So we're really looking forward to a whole season of good rowing.
Valley Water officials telling us that Lexington Reservoir is one of the most recent reservoirs to start spilling since the winter storms started.
 uvas reservoir in South County has been spilling for a good week. Almaden reservoir on and off, Coyote reservoir been spilling
But the good news is, aside from some local flooding....officials aren't expecting widespread problems or issues with these spills....especially if people take in beautiful views like these at a safe distance.
 we don't want anyone to be hurt in the rushing water.
With that said, all of this water will bring major benifits to the region. 
 we are filling our reservoirs. And those are our local reservoirs that will help with recharging groundwater basin. So are happy about that from a water supply perspective.
Still, Valley Water says we need to get to April First with a healthy snowpack in the Sierra and get more water allocated to our area before we can even think of being out of the drought.
For now, onlookers at Lexington Reservoir continue to hope that the reservoir stays at healthy levels...not just to end the drought but to help their community heal from it's impacts.
 I think a lot of people that we haven't seen rowing for a long time are going to come back.
Valley Water tells me that they expect the spilling at Lexington Reservoir to stop in the next three days and at other reservoirs within a week or two.
This time of year they can't keep the reservoirs completely full in case more storms come so they will be releasing some of the water until the spring when we typically don't expect as much rain.
Live in San Jose, Zach Fuentes ABC7 news.


We have live crews tonight across the bay area with a look at the worst storm damage... and there is a lot of it.

Good Evening,  I'm Dan Ashley.
and I'm Ama Daetz.
We begin in the East Bay and a neighborhood demanding more be done after a massive tree left a family without a home.
Right now - Neighbors are concerned about *other trees coming down after this one fell and sent a father to the hospital with serious injuries.
Tonight - ABC 7 News Reporter J.R. Stone has more from Castro Valley.
Let's bring in Spencer Christian now because we have just one more bit of storm to keep an eye on tomorrow... 
And check this out...
A HUGE change in California's landscape -- noticed from NASA's satellite view.
This first photo is what it looked like from space on September 1st last year.
And now the photo from today... much different.
The National Weather Service says San Francisco just saw its wettest 22-day period in 140 years.
 Now to your voice -- and your vote.
Despite being two years away from the 20-24 election...
Some in California are already campaigning ahead.
Congresswoman Katie Porter was in Walnut Creek tonight -- kicking off her bid to fill the U-S Senate seat currently held by Dianne Feinstein. 
As ABC7 News reporter Tim Johns tell us, Porter's campaign is already making waves. 
The Golden State Warriors had some politics of their own to attend to today... sort of.
President Biden and Vice President Harris invited the team and their families to the White House to celebrate their N-B-A title.
Not only hailed as champs - the Warriors were also recognized for using their high profile to force positive change. 
A massive mudslide stopped a train in its tracks today... 225 passengers were stranded for several hours.
The "ACE 5" train came up to the mudslide just after eight this morning near Niles Canyon Road in Sunol.
After about four hours, another train came to rescue the stranded passengers - who were then escorted to buses to get them to their destinations.
George McElroy -- one of the riders -- shared his frustration.

 
There were no reported injuries from today's incident...
But Niles Canyon has been a highly impacted area by storms and mudslides in the last few weeks.
Also in attendance today... three of the Bay Area's most legendary rappers. 


You see "Mistah FAB" with the camera... along with E-40... "Too Short" and the D-J known as "Sway" who was born in Oakland.
ABC7 news Sports Director Larry Biel will have another full look at the Warriors' visit -- coming up later in sports.
I'm Kristen Sze.
You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today... a 50-year old Stanford murder mystery, solved. A serial killer finally admits to taking a young librarian's life.... but why did it take so long? What's slowing the processing of DNA evidence? And is this man responsible for more?
The San Francisco-based investigative journalist whose work helped law enforcement solve several of these Stanford murders will join us.
Also... ABC7 meteorologists warned us about driving to Tahoe this past weekend, yet, many not heed their warnings, including our friend Sophie Bearman with our media partner, the San Francisco Standard.
She's got some serious lessons learned from her experience... she'll share her video and tips I hadn't thought of for winter driving.
But first ... California's short term and long term water picture.
Sure, our recent 9 atmopsheric rivers have greatly built up our water supplies after several drought years... just take a look at this Lexington reservoir video we shot yesterday.
But reservoir management is getting ever more complicated, given the extreme weather we're facing more and more.
Joining us live now to talk about how we can ensure California's water supply... Jeanine Jones, interstate resources manager for the California Department of Water Resources.
**First, give us a snapshot of how our reservoirs are doing?
**is this going to meet our needs for a while? 
**do you think we'll be asked to conserve this summer after all this?
**you used to plan for drought or for floods... now it's simulatenous... how do you manage that?
**is most of this rain we've gotten just running off, being wasted so to speak? not capturable?
**In 2014, during the worst of last decade's drought, California voters approved billions for infrastructure that would catch and store much-needed water from winter storms. Have any of those projects gotten off the ground? Why?
**is the system built for the types of weather patterns global warming has created?
**what's exacerbated the shortage? rapid development and growth? witness the Arizona town that got its water cut off from Scottsdale because Scottsdale doesn't have enough for itself.... could that happen here in California?
**what's ideal in terms of infrastructure going forward? any models you can point to? do we have the money to pay for that?
**your title is interstate resources manager... do you work with other states to ensure a steady supply? is California going to be a taker or giver this year?


A mudslide halts a commuter train... which is just one of many problems throughout the Bay Area today.
The Dubs are in the House!
We'll have the Warriors first trip to the White House since 2016.

ABC7 news weather anchor Spencer Christian is up on the roof today soaking it in... are finally done with the rain?
This is video from Huntington Beach  -- as you can see that's a street under water a block up from sunset beach.
This area is prone to flooding ---No word yet on whether any of the homes that line the beach suffered any significant damage.
The train was supposed to come here to this San Jose station but it never made it as scheduled.
Thankfully there were no injuries reported as a result of the slide, still passengers tell me their commute and most of their day...was a nightmare.
The exact circumstances of what delayed the train are still under investigation...so details on whether the slide hit the train or if was the other way around have not been released.
ACE tells me that it's still too early to know if tomorrow's service will be back to normal.
They encourage people who ride the commuter train to make sure they're subscribed to text alerts and check social media channels.
Live in San Jose, Zach Fuentes ABC7 news.
zach...  how were people were moved on to the "rescue train"?
City crews in the east bay are busy tonight, clearing debris and repairing infrastructure brought down by mudslides.
Portions of Grizzly Peak Boulevard in the Berkeley Hills have been shutdown for much of the day, as utility crews work to remove power lines that came down across the roadway.
And on nearby Fish Ranch road, saturated hillsides gave way when a mudslide forced debris onto the road.
That road has since reopened to traffic.
A mudslide kept more than 200 people stuck on an ACE train in Niles Canyon for nearly four hours.
Frustrated passengers were eventually transferred to another train while their initial train stayed on the tracks, interrupting all afternoon service.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes spoke with passengers and joins us live from San Jose ... where passengers were supposed to end up.
zach.
Clean-up operations are underway following this flooding yesterday in San Diego.
Several people had to be rescued after trying to drive through the roads flooded by the San Diego river-- in the city's Mission Valley area.

The   abc7 bay area app is available on your Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV and google TV devices.
We're seeing dramatic video out of Palm Springs where fast flood waters are seen swallowing a truck trapped in the mud.
This video was taken at the whitewater wash in Palm springs.
Fire crews there say the driver of that truck tried driving through the wash to get around safety barricades in place, when they got struck.
Fortunately that driver did make it out and to the other side without injuries.
Fire crews got a lot more than they bargained for when they went to extinguish a house fire in Martinez.


Crews came across more than 70 dogs and cats inside the home on Barber Lane-- some of them had gotten out, and were running around the neighborhood.


Animal control officers had to be called in to assist, and put the dogs and cats into carriers, they're being housed by a breeder for now..
No animals died in the blaze, which started in the garage and spread to the second floor.
One of the three residents was treated for smoke inhalation.
The fire is not believed to be suspicious.
Two contractors working for pharmaceutical giant "Bayer" were hurt in a fire at the company's West Berkeley campus.

We are waiting for word on their conditions.
Now at 5-- 
Wild ride across the Bay Area.
The search for the suspect accused of stealing an ambulance in San Francisco.

The neighborhood where some homes are red-tagged.
Good morning.
It's Tuesday, January 17th.
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.

In the South Bay...
The widespread storm damage is blocking chances to get out and enjoy local parks again.
San Jose's popular Alum Rock Park is one of those closed for some time.
A park ranger describes Alum Rock as a "box canyon"-- where its sides are very steep.
Gravity alone can cause objects to slide down even in dry conditions.

 
Even the temporary, Hollywood-style Alum Rock sign that celebrated the park's 150 years in 20-22 is no more.
Park officials say there is a lot to do before the park can reopen.
That includes assess unknown damage on every trail, clearing out narrow trails by hand, or bringing in heavy equipment to do the job.
On the Peninsula...
A stretch of Highway One in Pacifica is back open.
A rockslide sent a large boulder tumbling into the road yesterday.
You can see just how big of a rock clogged the road.
Southbound lanes near Devil's Slide were blocked for several hours.
The C-H-P called for heavy equipment to be brought in to remove the boulder.
From rockslides ... to mudslides ... to pavement giving way ... there's no doubt this atmospheric river has taken a toll on our roads.
And now we know just *how much.
There have been more than 500 landslides across the state since December 30th.
 That's according to the California Geological Survey, which shared this map.
As you can see in blue, there's been a cluster of landslides in the Bay Area.
So why is California prone to this?
Geologists say it's because the state has relatively young mountains.
That means much of the steep terrain is still in motion -- and covered in loose rocks and soil that can easily slide away.
Crews across the Bay Area are assessing and cleaning up the storm damage.
The Golden Gate National Recreation Area shared this photo of an old military structure on the beach of Fort Funston in San Francisco.
It slid down a nearby bluff.  
Park officials say the structure tumbled off the cliff yesterday morning, likely because of the saturated land. 

 
 No one was hurt in the slide, but park staff reminds visitors to be cautious of their surroundings in the area.

ABC News reports that the DOJ considered sending FBI agents to the president's home to monitor the search for classified documents.
The DOJ ultimately agreed to *not bring in agents, and let lawyers carry out their own search back in November, because the Biden team was fully cooperating with the government.
Last week, five more pages of classified materials were found in the President's Delaware home.
House republicans are criticizing the administration and demanding for more information related to the searches for classified materials.


A White House spokesperson says that they are releasing information "as they deem appropriate."
The White House is expected to keep cooperating with the ongoing special counsel investigation into the classified documents.
Its still unclear right now how they will respond to the house republican's independent investigations.
President Biden faces new questions over the classified documents found at this home and private office, during his time as vice president under President Obama.

Hello, I'm Julian Glover.
And I'm Jobina Fortson.
We begin with another major hit on the tech industry. 
Google's parent company Alphabet will cut nearly 12-thousand jobs-- effective immediately in the U-S.
That's about 6 percent of the workforce worldwide for the mountain view based company.  
This will impact several teams including recruiting and some corporate functions... as well as engineering and products teams.
In the U-S, affected employees are getting a severance package.
It starts at 16 weeks salary plus two weeks for every additional year at Google.  
Also available-- bonuses and remaining vacation time will be paid, 6 months of healthcare, job placement services, and immigration support.
Alphabet's CEO  Sundar  Pichai sent a staff memo this morning, saying he takes full responsibility. 
He said in part quote. 
"Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today."
A town hall is scheduled for employees on Monday.

President Biden was here yesterday, getting an up close look at some of the hardest hit areas - including the Santa Cruz coast.
In Aptos, the president thanked first responders who have been hard at work.
He also talked about directing the federal government to cover 100-percent of the cost of removing debris... and emergency measures like sheltering evacuees and paying overtime for first responders for 60 days.


The Department of Agriculture will also be helping farmers with disaster loans and grants. 
The Small Business Administration will offer similar assistance to businesses.
President Biden's visit to Capitola Village was brief but left a big impact. 
Business owners dealing with storm damage say it gave them motivation to push forward.
Zelda's was one of the hardest hit restaurants along this strip.
Debris from trees is still inside the dining room.
The president stood where their outdoor patio used to be. 


Zelda's is hoping to reopen by spring break. 
Just a bit farther south of the President's visit...
Another iconic stretch of California coast -- Big Sur --is being pummeled by storm damage.
A large portion of the town's beaches, hiking trails and other attractions are shut down.
Highway 1, the main path in and out of Big Sur, remains closed from Monterey county all the way to San Simeon... just south of town... and most of Big Sur's natural sights are off-limits.
We have seen more than 600 landslides and mudslides since the start of the storms on December 30th.
Experts think there could be more.


We have seen landslides and mudslides continue to pop up over the past week - including two in Niles Canyon that forced ACE to suspend train service.
Experts say the threat of landslides can last weeks and possibly even months after a storm period we experienced.
 Intel is also slashing hundreds of jobs.
This is adding to layoffs that began late last year.
Intel will cut 201 jobs at its offices in Santa Clara;s headquarters by the end of the month.

Silicon Valley is playing host to gamers from across the country this weekend.
Many excited to be back together since pandemic.

 
The much-needed boost to business the "Genesis 9" gaming convention is bringing to the South Bay.


First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
There's a call tonight from country's Attorney General in the battle against the drug overdose crisis. 
Merrick Garland is pleading with local officials to keep pouring in the effort.
And as ABC7 News reporter Tara Campbell tells us, more help is on the way. 
 "Each of you understands better than most the human toll of this crisis." 
Attorney General Merrick Garland making the fentanyl crisis a focus at the Conference of Mayors Friday in DC.  
 "As mayors, you have witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by fentanyl poisonings and overdoses."
San Francisco Mayor London Breed in DC . . . for the timely message . . . announcing this week a push to establish privately-funded safe consumption sites . . . and the District Attorney describing an all-hands-on-deck approach.
 "We are trying to intervene on every level. We have to cut supply but we also want to decrease demand because that's what's going to cut off supply but also help individuals change their lives  save their lives." 
Nearly 107,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2021, according to the CDC. Six-hundred and twenty-five of those deaths were In San Francisco; the majority caused by fentanyl. 
 "In 2022, the DEA and its law enforcement partners seized more than 50.6 million fentanyl-laced, fake prescription pills," he said. That is more than double the amount seized in 2021. 
The DEA also seized more than 10,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. 
 "Together, these seizures represent more than 379 million potentially deadly doses of fentanyl. That much fentanyl could kill every single American."
And the numbers show a similar situation in San Francisco. 
In just the last two years, 12 times the amount of fentanyl has been seized from the streets of theTenderloin.
 "When we think about this a minimum lethal dose of Fentanyl is about 2 milligrams so the amount of fentanyl that one police district took off of drug dealers it's enough lethal doses of fentanyl to kill every adult in California." 
Last year the DOJ poured more 340 million dollars into helping communities combat the crisis. And he says more will be coming down the pike . . . along with continued effort to crack down on cartels and dealers. 
 The Department of Justice is using every tool at it's disposal to save American lives))

It's streaming now on our ABC7 Bay Area app ... and our website, ABC7 News dot com.
As storm clean-up continues around the Bay Area, a home in Orinda is a total loss after a landslide.
The force of that ripped the house from its base and sent it sliding down a hill.
A county building inspector deemed the home unsafe on Wednesday, so the family was not there when the slide happened yesterday.
A home next door has been yellow-tagged and neighbors say they are staying alert.
There have been ten police chiefs in Oakland in the past ten years.
Howard Jordan took over from Anthony Batts in 2011.
In 2013 Jordan stepped down citing medical reasons. 
He was replaced by Anthony Toribio - who lasted just two days. 
A federal overseer was reportedly about to oust both Jordan and Toribio ... but both resigned first.
Sean Whent then took over for the next three years ... until a sex scandal rocked the department ... and a series of chiefs who lasted just days.
Ben Fairow, Paul Figueroa and finally City Administrator Sabrina Landreth took over for just over six months.
Anne Kirkpatrick was chief from January 2017 to February 2020.
She was fired ... and, as we mentioned, successfully sued for wrongful termination.
Darren Allison was acting chief for less than two months - and he's currently the acting chief once more.
Susan Manheimer held the office for less than a year before taking an early retirement.
She was replaced by LeRonne Armstrong - who again, is on administrative leave.
Police in Oakland are looking for a suspect connected to an attempted rape.
This is the man police are looking for.
The victim in this case tells officers they were cornered by him at the store where they work on International Boulevard.
That victim fought back -- and got away unharmed.
Police describe the suspect as a Black man, standing about 6-feet-2 inches, with medium length hair covering his ears.
If you recognize this person, call police.
After multiple mudslides and two road closures over the past week, Niles Canyon Road finally reopened today!
Various mudslides have popped up across the Bay Area ... including two at Niles Canyon -- with one stopping service on an ACE train.
Caltrans says drivers in the area should still be cautious and lookout for debris on the road.
In Santa Cruz, temporary traffic controls are now in place along West Cliff Drive.
It's so construction crews can assess the damage to the street and walkway caused by this month's storms.
They will complete an emergency stabilization plan, starting Monday at 6 A-M.
Drivers can expect detours ... and one-way traffic between Columbia Street and Woodrow Avenue. 
Next week, BART's board of directors will consider censuring one of its members over a racist and insensitive comment.
Director John McPartland used the term during a "Racial Equity Initiative" presentation.
The board will also consider whether or not to remove him from committees he's currently serving on.
Also next week, BART's board will discuss ways to remedy the agency's budget shortfall.  
Low ridership since the pandemic has severely impacted BART's services, which rely on fare revenues.
Some suggestions to cut costs include closing select stations, cutting weekend service, and mass layoffs.
In the East Bay, officials at Richmond High School are hoping classes will be back in session Monday, after shutting down early today because of a bad smell.
An "electrical burning" sent a strong smell through the main campus, forcing everyone out.
School maintenance crews say they will spend the weekend looking for the cause of that smell.
New developments tonight out of San Francisco ...
The city's Latino Task Force is offering free lead testing for students at Buena Vista Horace Mann School.
During a construction project last year, elevated levels of lead were discovered in the soil in a courtyard and multiple faucets.
Free screenings started today at a health clinic at 24th and Capp Street.
Students and their families can walk in tomorrow from 9 A-M to 4 P-M.
The free screenings will also be available the next two Saturdays after that.
Tomorrow, Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao will make her first public comments on the decision to place Police Chief Leronne Armstrong on paid leave.
According to ABC7 I-Team sources, Armstrong is off the job for "dereliction of duty" after he reportedly failed to take action on a sergeant who ripped the bumper off a neighbor's car during a hit and run accident. 
That sergeant later fired a gun in an elevator at police headquarters.  
Former Oakland Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick calls it a setback. 
 She was fired in 2020 for reporting alleged misconduct.
She filed a lawsuit disputing her termination, and won.


The Oakland Police Department remains under federal oversight, which has being ongoing for 20 years, following past cases of brutality and misconduct.

Also ...The Lunar New Year is just two days away. We'll look ahead to the big celebration planned for the Vietnamese community in the South Bay..and chat with a couple of the organizers.  
But first ...
A new year…and a new round of tech layoffs.
Just this week, Microsoft announced cutting 10-thousand jobs…and this morning Google's parent company Alphabet said it planned to lay off 12-thousand workers. 
There have been more than 55-thousand layoffs at 151 tech companies this January alone.
To help make sense of this--Joining us me now is Steve Levy, director and senior economist at the "Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy".

 I think we all want to know WHY this is happening. For the past few years it felt like tech could do no wrong!
 Can you give us some perspective here—because even though cutting 10-thousand jobs seems like a lot, it's a small percentage of total workers at Microsoft. They also did a LOT of hiring in recent years.
How is this affecting our economy as a whole? I wonder because during the pandemic—and this move to "work from home" we saw a lot of other smaller businesses suffer, like restaurants in the financial district.
 This next question is about those who are now in search for new employment. I think it's easy to say tech workers are always in demand…but a friend of mine got laid off at a social media company and says the competition is fierce!
 A number of tech workers are on work visas  the H-B-1. Oftentimes these workers are from India and China and wait years for a green card. What does this mean when you're holding an HB-1 and get laid off?
 What's your prediction for the rest of 2023?  Will this trend of layoffs continue?
Dramatic video out of the East Bay.
Ground ... sliding right out from under a home.
The house in orinda ... now in pieces and neighbors worried about their own homes.
and... dereliction of duty.
the accusations made against Oakland's police chief... now on adminstrative leave.
ABC7 Insider Phil Matier is here with us now...
*Phil - what's going on over in Oakland? 10 police chiefs in 10 years...?
*Do you think Armstrong will be able to overcome this and remain chief?
*What is the latest on the federal oversight - how long is that expected to continue?
new mayor sheng thao. 1st major crisis.
More layoffs coming to the tech industry.
Google's parent company said it would cut its staff by 6 percent in its largest ever round of layoffs.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey spoke with a tech expert about the impact on Silicon Valley.
There have been ten police chiefs in Oakland in the past ten years.
Howard Jordan took over from Anthony Batts in 2011.
In 2013 Jordan stepped down citing medical reasons. 
He was replaced by Anthony Toribio - who lasted just two days. 
A federal overseer was reportedly about to oust both Jordan and Toribio ... but both resigned first.
Sean Whent then took over for the next three years... until a sex scandal rocked the department ... and a series of chiefs who lasted just days.
Ben Fairow, Paul figueroa and finally City Administrator Sabrina Landreth took over for just over six months.
Anne Kirkpatrick was chief from January 2017 to February 2020. she was fired ... and successfully sued for wrongful termination.
Darren Allison was acting chief for less than two months - he's currently the acting chief once more...
Susan Manheimer held the office as interim chief for less than a year ... 
she was replaced by LeRonne Armstrong.
We just word that Oakland Mayor Shang Thao will speak about the chief tomorrow...
but today we're getting new reaction from other officials and community leaders about the decision to place Chief  Leronne Armstrong on paid leave.
This after the chief reportedly failed to take action on misconduct allegations by one of of his own officers.  
The Assistant chief is now in charge.  
ABC7 News Reporter Cornell Barnard has more.
Thousands of tech employees wondering if they might be the next layoffs in the industry learned their fate today.
Google's parent company said it would cut its staff by 6 percent in its largest ever round of layoffs.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey spoke with a tech expert to figure out why this happened and how this impacts Silicon Valley.
Once sitting atop of the financial mountain during the pandemic... tech companies are feeling the effects of a return to normalcy.
The bottom line for giants like Meta, Microsoft and now Google is forcing employees to feel the heat.
And San Jose State University Professor and tech expert Ahmed Banafa says those cuts start with employees... like we saw today at Google.
12,000 employees from Google's parent company Alphabet join the other tens of thousands recently cut from companies across Silicon Valley as they weigh budget decisions for 2023.
Just a matter of months removed from the tech sector hiring 200,000 plus employees... more than double what we saw in the previous decade according to Banafa.
Banafa says these cuts have a trickle down effect because thousands of employees now have less money to spend... leading to cuts in other industries.
But this is not permanent.
Employees are being hired back at other tech companies... or in other tech roles.
So this may be a temporary downswing... but Banafa says this isn't 2008 or the Dot COM era... and it won't slow down the prominence of Silicon Valley.
In the South Bay Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
You can keep track of the mass layoffs by tech companies both big and small across the bay area.

LAWMAKERS ARE NOW CALLING ON THE STATE TO CHANGE GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S PROPOSED BUDGET TO INCLUDE SORELY NEEDED TRANSIT OPERATIONS FUNDING FOR AGENCIES LIKE BART HERE IN PLEASANTON -- WHICH SO MANY PEOPLE RELY ON…. AFTER THEY'RE PROPOSED TO BE CUT BY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. 

 
BAY AREA SENATOR SCOTT WIENER SAYS -- THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO MAKE CUTS -- AS AGENCIES ARE ALREADY UP AGAINST THEIR OWN SHORTFALLS FROM RIDERSHIP LEVELS STILL NOT RETURNING TO PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS, RISING OPERATING COSTS FROM INFLATION AND FEDERAL EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS SET TO RUN OUT, FOR SOME, IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR. 

 
WITHOUT THAT STATE FUNDING  TO ADDRESS BUDGET SHORTFALLS, WHICH SOME AGENCIES LIKE BART ARE ALREADY FACING  SENATOR WIENER WORRIES MANY AGENCIES COULD BE FORCED TO IMPLEMENT MAJOR SERVICE CUTS… RESULTING IN AGENCIES RAISING THEIR FARES OR SLOWING DOWN MUCH NEEDED CAPITAL PROJECTS. 
AND IT THROWS A WRENCH IN THE STATE'S CLIMATE PLAN  LEADING TO FEWER MOBILITY OPTIONS, INCREASED DRIVING, CONGESTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 
 
 
IN HIS LETTER TO STATE LEADERS  HE SAID "WE UNDERSTAND THE STATE IS PROJECTING A BUDGET SHORTFALL AND THAT DIFFICULT CHOICES MUST BE MADE. HOWEVER, ALLOWING TRANSIT SYSTEMS TO UNRAVEL WOULD HAVE LONG TERM, POSSIBLY IRREVERSIBLE, DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND CLIMATE GOALS."  

  
INSTEAD OF TRANSIT FUNDING -- NEWSOM'S CURRENT PLAN VOWS TO MAKE NO CUTS TO THE STATE'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND COMMITTED MILLIONS MORE TO COMBAT THE STATE'S HOMELESS AND OPIOID CRISES.  
LIVE IN PLEASANTON, LENA HOWLAND, ABC7 NEWS.

This is a live picture from Emeryville, where momentarily Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong will make his first public comments since the news broke of Mayor Sheng Thao's decision to place him on leave.
According to a report that investigated alleged misconduct by the O -P-D... Armstrong reportedly failed to take action on a sergeant who ripped the bumper off a neighbor's car during a hit-and-run crash. 
That sergeant later fired a gun in a department elevator. 
The report is in relation to the federal oversight of the Oakland Police Department, which has been ongoing for 20 years.
We'll take you to the News Conference as soon as it begins. 
Governor Newsom visited Monterey Park and shared these photos.

We need real gun reform at a national level."
President Biden issued this statement saying in part, quote...
"While there is still much we don't know about the motive in this senseless attack, we do know that many families are grieving, or praying that their loved one will recover from their wounds."

New developments in a public toilet drama in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood.
According to the Chronicle, the project  is going to cost about a million dollars -- despite the fact the entire pre-fabricated bathroom is being donated!

Plans for the bathroom were first unveiled last fall -- with a 1-point-7 million dollar price tag funded by the state.
Then the funding was pulled after backlash about the price.
That's when a Nevada company stepped in to donate the bathroom and costs to install it.

A homeless man is dead tonight after catching fire in a Santa Rosa parking lot.
It happened along Santa Rosa Avenue... not far from Highway 101.
And as ABC7 News reporter Tara Campbell Reports -- police believe the deadly opioid fentanyl was involved.
Nats
Jose Pacheco is pointing to where a homeless man caught fire and died early Saturday morning . . . in Santa Rosa . . . beside this dumpster . . . . 
 I found it pretty surprising because it happened in our backyard here and kind of came out of nowhere." 
Reports of a fire . . . in this parking lot  just off of Santa Rosa Avenue . . . began coming in just after midnight . . . .
  Sgt. Santa Rosa)) When officers and the fire department arrived on scene they actually found that the fire was actually a male. It looked like he had accidentally set himself on fire."
Sgt. Christopher Mahurin is spokesperson for the Santa Rosa Police Department. 
He says been able to piece together some of what happened using surveillance video. 
 Prior to the fire actually being started the individual who we believe to be homeless used some sort of narcotic and used a lighter to light the narcotics and then immediately kind of slumped down and laid on the ground after using the narcotics." 
Based on the man's response . . . . they believe he was likely using Fentanyl  — the powerful opioid fueling the drug overdose crisis . . . in the Bay Area and beyond — 
 "We believe had some sort of crystal gels in his backpack that are used to light up and keep warm. We believe some of the gels and residue from them was on his hands or clothes."
And when the man lit the drug . . . they believe that likely started the fire.
 "Causing the residue to heat up and then smolder on his clothing and ultimately turned into a flame while he was asleep. 
This as Sonoma County clears a homeless encampment at the nearby Joe Rodota Trail... temporarily closing part of it down.
While the City of Santa Rosa . . . also works to help the unhoused.  
 "Our goal regularly with our downtown enforcement team is to get them into permanent supportive housing so that way even if they're using narcotics and something goes at least they're in a safe environment where these kinds of accidents won't take place."

The renovation process started back in 2014... with the bulk construction completed late last year.
Former Oakland city councilperson and Sheng Thao's former opponent in the race for mayor...is speaking out against her decision to place the police chief on leave.

"After reviewing the 16-page investigative report ... I have come to the conclusion that the decision to put Chief Armstrong on Administrative leave was excessive, and if I were Mayor, I would not have done it."
Taylor went on to say that he feels the level of the discipline does not match the nature of the infraction.

The unit was operating as three teams of about 30 officers, which claimed to target violent offenders in areas hit by high crime.
"Scorpion" has been inactive since Nichols' arrest nearly three weeks ago.

Ten others were injured.
Overnight, law enforcement searched the gunman's  Hemet home.

These images are of the fight for the gun.
One of the men you can see here, disarmed the suspect.
He's being credited as a hero preventing further tragedy.

We begin with THE public toilet drama. 
According to the Chronicle, the project  is going to cost about a million dollars -- despite the fact the entire   pre-fabricated bathroom is being donated!
It's because of the lengthy approval process required in the city -- that includes six departments and PG&E.
Plans for the bathroom were first unveiled last fall -- with a 1-point-7 million dollar price tag funded by the state.
Then the funding was pulled after backlash about the price.
That's when a Nevada company stepped in to donate the bathroom and costs to install it.
Our other focus is about tiktok. 
it confirms employees have the ability to help videos go viral.
Sources reveal to Forbes that staff can strategically place videos in users 'for you  pages' in a practice known as "heating".
They say the feature is commonly used to supercharge videos featuring brands and  influencers who are partnering with  TikTok.

We're talking about THE OSCARS 
and Meta layoffs.
We begin with  the oscars!
It was a historic Oscars for the asian community.
Everything Everywhere All At Once won 7 oscars -- including best picture, best actress and both supporting acting awards.
German war epic All Quiet on the western front had a good night as well.
Some of the speeches -- were also memorable icnluding from Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. 
We'll talk to an entertainment reporter in a few minutes.
Our other focus...
We're learning that Meta is planning to announce these layoffs in multiple rounds—which in total would be about the same as the 13 percent cut to the company's workforce last year. That equated to about 11,000 jobs. 
According to the wall street journal—the first wave of the new cuts is set to be announced next week. 
Projects that reportedly being cut-- suggest that Meta may be pulling back on products that popularize virtual and augmented relaity.  

 


We'll be right back!
In the East Bay -- two southbound lanes of 880 ARE REOPENED in Fremont after being closed for several hours because of flooding.
All Northbound lanes remain closed.

We're learning that Meta is planning to announce these layoffs in multiple rounds—which in total would be about the same as the 13 percent cut to the company's workforce last year. That equated to about 11,000 jobs. 
According to the wall street journal—the first wave of the new cuts is set to be announced next week. Meta shares rose by more than 2% in after-hours trading following The Wall Street Journal's report on the planned cuts. 
Projects that reportedly being cut-- suggest that Meta may be pulling back on products that popularize virtual and augmented relaity.  
According to a person familiar with the matter who chatted with the Wall Street journal--employees who are laid off should expect the severance is expected to be roughly the same as what was offered in November. 
San Francisco-based "Allbirds" is also seeing its fortune drop significantly.
Its stock is down significantly just a year after it went public.

Once branches open this morning, customers *will have access to all their funds.
Relief comes as the president addressed the nation at the top of the hour.
He spoke specifically about failed Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank of New York.
The president, committing to holding those responsible, accountable--
As he continues to push efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks.
S-V-B being the 16th largest bank in the country, holding 210-billion dollars in assets.
The F-D-I-C says depositors will have that full access through bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bank,  N.A.--
It'll open and resume normal banking hours, and activities, including online banking.


And that bridge bank is to designed to essentially *bridge the gap between the failure of a bank and the time when stability and resolution could be made by the F-D-I-C.
There has been worry over potential of an even greater risk of what the major collapse might mean for regional and smaller banks.
But this isn't a bailout-- something stressed by President Biden.
Funds will come from an F-D-I-C account.
Different from the taxpayer-funded bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis.

And tonight -- Governor Newsom is taking aim at the mental health and addiction crisis in California.
It's part of his days-long tour delivering bold new policy plans across the state.
In San Diego today - he pushed to invest billions into new "campus-style" mental health facilities... to house those who are struggling.
ABC7 News Reporter Tara Campbell spoke to those with loved ones living out on the streets... about how this might help.
Jacquie Berlinn's son has been battling anxiety, depression and addiction on the streets of the Tenderloin . . . for more than a decade . . . 
 "I'm so grateful for Newsom's realizing that there's a tremendous need for mental health services in California. 
 "We have to address and come to grips with the reality of mental health in this state and our nation." 
Governor Newsom announcing a sweeping proposal Sunday  . . . to expand housing and treatment for people suffering from mental illness and addiction . 
 "We're looking at supporting minimum 6000 beds that's gone through a multi-year needs assessment. That would provide support for 10 to 12 thousand individuals each and every year."
It's a move Berlinn and others have been calling for . . . for years. 
 "We've come across so many families in California that are struggling to get the support that they need for their loved ones. "
 "It's unacceptable what we're dealing with at scale now in the state of California, not only terms of what we're dealing with on the streets and sidewalk, but those that are suffering alone, those that are unseen in homes, in mobile home parks, on the streets obviously as well, in isolation.
The Governor is asking lawmakers and voters to approve a 2024 ballot measure . . .  investing up to five billion dollars to build new mental health campuses, residental housing, and permanent supportive housing . . .  across the state. 
The plan also puts a billion dollars a year into operating the sites. 
 "To set aside and prioritze the most the acute challenge the state faces and that's the integration of housing and the supportive services that would need to be stacked onto that housing to stabalize individuals that are in acute states of phychosais, people that self-medicating with drug or alcohol addictions."
As for Berlinn . . . she says the potential investment is an offering of hope.
((Berlinn) I'm very hopeful that this is just one step in the right direction that there will continue to be added support for Californians and their mental health."

San Quentin is California's oldest prison. 
Construction began in 1852 ... prisoners worked on building it and slept on a nearby prison ship until it was complete in 1854.
Both male and female prisoners were incarcerated there until 1933.
It has housed the state's only gas chamber and death row since 1938 ... although the last execution there was in 2006.
Newsom announced a moratorium on executions in 2019 and in 2022 he began transferring inmates sentenced to death to other prisons. 
It's a well know prison - housing a number of infamous prisoners including Charles Manson, Richard Ramirez, Sirhan Sirhan and Scott Peterson.
Two famously rehabbed former inmates are Merle Haggard and actor Danny Trejo.

Now to our other top story...
California is making some bold moves today in the prison system.


Governor Newsom is announcing major changes at San Quentin.


Now at 5...prison plan push back. 
Why some Californians say the Governor's project to transform the San Quentin Prison will not work... and what it means for prisoners. 
People are upset after Governor Newsom announced his plan to transform San Quentin State Prison into a Rehabilitation Center. 
Marc Klaas - founder of the Klaas kids foundation - says the plan will not work for violent offenders.


Klaas' 12-year-old daughter, Polly, was kidnapped and murdered by Richard Allen Davis.
He says Davis was formally released into society from a rehabilitation center ... and killed his daughter a few months later. 
ABC7 News Insider Phil Matier gave insight into what it would take for the plan to flop.


Crime victim advocates say the governor never reached out to them.
They say his plan is best suited for low crime offenders.


Transforming San Quentin from a state prison to a rehabilitation center.
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.
Today Governor Newsom outlined his plan to change San Quentin, including its new name and new mission.
ABC7 news reporter Cornell Barnard joins us live with the details.
Elizabeth Holmes was back in a federal courthouse in San Jose.
The former Theranos CEO wants a judge to delay her prison sentence while her case is in appeal.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes was in court today where there was a disturbance before arguments could get underway.))
Taking the same route she's made for several years now, Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes made her way back to the Federal court house in San Jose.
The same place where her trial took place - Holmes was convicted in January of 2022 on four counts of defrauding investors while running her failed blood testing start-up.
Sentenced to 11 years in prison and ordered to turn herself in April 27th...she's now asking a judge to delay her sentence while she appeals the conviction.
As Holmes walked in with her family, a woman tried to serve her papers...Holmes let them fall to the sidewalk...
The documents show Theranos creditors are trying to sue her in a civil case.
Neither Holmes nor her attorneys spoke to cameras outside of court...
*Inside, things got active before court even began.
As everyone waited for Judge Edward Davila to walk in...a man walked through the gallery where we were sitting and straight past the partition to approach Holmes with papers.
It's unknown what the documents said or if the man had any connection to the woman outside who attempted to serve Holmes.
As federal agents began to escort him out, the man tried to escape them to go near Holmes's mother.
Agents held him back and took him out of the building...
Once court began....U.S. Attorneys and Holmes defense began arguing about whether Holmes should pay restitution to investors and what amount.
A decision the judge says he'll likely make the first week in April.
The hearing then turned to that request to delay her 11 year prison sentence while she appeals.
Attorneys for Holmes say her sentence should be delayed because she is the mom of two small children, one of them a newborn.
US attorneys say Holmes has plenty of family support in the U.S.
We spoke with Legal Analyst Steven Clark after court about those points.
 Miss Holmes, she's saying, I want time to bond with those kids. I don't want to make them be punished for something I have done. And there's really no harm in allowing this delay to occur. But the government is saying, We gave you that time, and time's up. And now you have to start serving your time, just like everybody else who has small children.
Federal prosecutors also say Holmes is a flight risk after booking a one-way ticket in January of 2022 to Mexico following her conviction.
Attorneys spent much of the time arguing about whether that ticket purchase points to her being a flight risk.
Her defense attorneys say Holmes booked the one-way ticket ahead of her conviction, hoping that she'd be acquitted and added that she may have driven back home.
U.S. attorneys aruged otherwise.
 It's definitely an indicator of who she is, as a person that she is someone with unbridled optimism that she feels I was never going to get convicted. And that's why I bought the ticket to Mexico. And not to flee. But because I thought I would be able to go on vacation.
For now Holmes remains out on bail while the judge makes his decsion.
It's expected to given the first week of April.

There has been a steady rainfall for much of Sunday evening. The big difference that we've noticed in this storm is the wind. Doesn't feel nearly as strong as it was in past storms but there have still been major issues on roadways and in neighborhoods.
In Menlo Park this massive tree took down power lines and blocked a driveway to a residence. Firefighters were still waiting for PG&E when we were there. No one was hurt but fire crews advised the homeowner to stay inside until the lines were clear. In this neighborhood we also came across a number of branches leaning against power lines.
The roadways have been an issue too. In San Mateo the driver of this mustang lost control on the Highway 101 entrance ramp and ended up in a ditch. The driver wasn't hurt, just a bit embarrassed over what happened. The tow truck then showed up to get the car out of that ditch.
Those we have been talking too say they don't mind the rain but they're ready for some nicer weather.

The San Francisco Public Library is hosting a "Freedom To Learn Summit" in response to an increase in book bans across the country.
 The event aims to protect free expression.
There will be workshops and activities for high school students so they can learn skills to combat book-banning and educational censorship.

It's become a familiar scene during what seems like a never-ending storm season.
This week, we saw massive trees toppling over, landing on houses... and cars ... and some of those incidents even turned deadly. 
In  Menlo Park, some residents are frustrated with the process to remove trees that pose a hazard.
As ABC7 news reporter Lauren Martinez found out, one woman is taking matters into her own hands.
We have an update on the San Francisco Police Officer who was seriously hurt after a tree came down on his car while he was working.

And because of that the state is now lifting some drought-related provisions on water use, including lifting a state campaign asking people to voluntarily cut water use by 15%. 
Yesterday, Governor Gavin Newsom announced drought restrictions will ease. 
Storm after storm made this year one of the wettest years on record in California... following three of the *driest years on record.
The governor says it's the unpredictable changes that make it important to keep conserving.


Newsom also announced an end to the level two drought contingency plan for local water agencies.
He introduced his plan to increase storage efforts through groundwater recharge,  stormwater capture, reservoir storage, and more. 
The DEA is warning the public, especially parents, about a deadly animal tranquilizer being mixed into Fentanyl.

Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.


All that rain and the persistent high winds is being blamed for widespread damage across the bay area this morning.
Many businesses, homeowners, and communities waking up this morning to begin the clean up process.
ABC 7 news reporter Amanda Del Castillio is in the east bay where emergency crews were busy.
Amanda....
Very busy— with a lot of incidents in short amount of time…
That’s how some Bay Area Fire officials are describing their response during yesterday’s powerful wind and rain.
An example of one major incident behind me— a tree, crushing the side of the lighthouse Baptist church in Pleasanton.
Incredible video of the actual tree *falling was captured by someone at a neighboring business who was attempting to capture footage of the strong winds.
The tree also damaged the roof of a home next door. Fortunately, no one was home.
There *were people inside the church at the time… including churchgoer Carol Bryson who was in upstairs – next to the part of the church that collapsed.


We were also in Contra Costa County where Steve Hill with with the fire protection district says they had an unprecedent day, dealing with the wind.
Gusting at 70 miles an hour in some areas.
So busy, Hill says they had to call up staff who don’t often respond to incidents. 
For now, clean up continues.
 A Marin County family left their home -- worried a 120-foot tall tree would come crashing down.
You can see the bottom of the tree beginning to uproot... barely clinging to the ground. 
A neighbor tells us he's been worried about the impact of the wind, especially because a tree fell on his home 15 years ago.

 
Utility workers have been working around the clock, despite the rain, to clean up downed trees, debris and anything else that may have blown away because of the wind. 
In San Mateo County -- falling trees created a big mess on Interstate 280 in the Millbrae area.
The trees caused the Southbound lanes to be closed for a while -- before cars were eventually able to drive around them.
The wind also took down an awning at San Carlos Eye Care, blocking one of it's entrances. 

 
In Belmont, two trees came down on a playground and school field. 
First responders worked to secure the area. 
No one was hurt and the school was not damaged. 
In San Francisco's Financial District, a shelter in place order has been lifted after a skyscraper's window broke, sending chunks of glass falling from the sky. 
One man captured the frightening moments on video. 

 
No one was hurt, but witnesses say the glass barely missed people walking on the street. 
It happened on the 43rd floor of 555 California Street, which used to be the Bank of America Center. 
People who were inside the building say they heard windows creaking and felt like the building was shaking all day. 

 
Investigators believe the wind likely caused the window to break. 
Firefighters say it happened in an empty area of the building that was under renovation. 
On the peninsula, a camera captured the moment a falling tree almost hit a van as it drove past.
This was in the Brentwood neighborhood of south San Francisco yesterday.
Fortunately, that tree didn't hit anything as it came down.
In the South Bay-- a scary situation for students after a redwood tree fell onto an elementary school in Los Altos. 
It happened at Oak Avenue School.
2nd and 3rd graders were inside a classroom with a teacher when the tree came crashing onto the roof.
A girl suffered a head injury -- but will be okay.
Not too far away, another tree fell into one woman's yard.
Now, she has safety concerns while she waits for repairs from the city. 

 
She's not the only one dealing with this. 
We saw several trees down in that neighborhood, damaging homes and cars.
One lingering effect of the latest storm is power outages.
PG&E crews have been working through the night to get the lights back on for people.
Let's take a look at PG&E's live outage map.
A little more than 200 thousand customers are still in the dark right now.
The largest outages are on the Peninsula and in the South Bay.
At one point yesterday -- 300-thousand PG&E customers were without power.
PG&E says they did their best to prepare for this latest storm.

 
A good idea is to get extra batteries for your flashlights, and have a big cooler for any food you need to refrigerate.
P-G-and-E is also asking for your patience. 
It may be awhile before full power is restored.
If you're wondering just how much rain we've had in the bay area so far - check this out.
In Santa Rosa - the average rain per year is just over 33 inches -- we've now had more than 24 inches.
There are still nearly another six months left in the rain year.
In Oakland - the average is 18-inches.
We're already at 26 and a half.
and in San Francisco - we've gone well past the average... closing in on 28 inches.
Now at 6...
Heavy winds and rain causing big trouble across the bay area.
A tree falls onto an east bay church.
Clean up beginning as thousands remain in the dark.
and winds so strong -- they rip glass panels off a high rise -- and sned them crashing down to the streets below.
plus -- sharing is caring -- but not everyone agrees.
more and more people saying They don't want to share their food.
Good Morning.
It's Wednesday, March 15th.
First let's check your  forecast.
Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.
The worst of the storms are gone -- but many of you will likely spend the day cleaning up from the mess the rain and wind left behind.

 "You can't blame the man. Can't blame the board of supervisors. We all must accept blame."
Calling  for a more holistic approach to helping the unhoused.
 "We must not have simplistic, reductionist thinking and planning anymore on this issue of homelessness, of unhoused people in this town." 
And San Francisco's District Attorney . . .  Brooke Jenkins . . . agrees. 
 "I don't think any of us believe we should just usher people off of the streets to nowhere  but instead they have a place to go and receive the treatment they need." 
And she says . . . the criminal justice system must do better . . . 
 "In recent history in the DA's office we had a situation with people being referred to programs that were not appropriate for their particular issue or were not sufficient to treat their specific problem." 
Meanwhile . . . Pastor Brown is calling for an apology from the gallery owner. 
 "It would be the gentleman-like humane thing to do and I've been trying to get a hold of him."

In Downtown Half Moon Bay, Amanda del Castillo, ABC7 News.
California already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, and the firearm used in Half Moon Bay was purchased legally.
However, that hasn't stopped the growing calls for more measures to be taken, not just at a state, but a national level. 
Despite faring far worse than many peer countries abroad, California's per capita rate for gun related deaths remains one of the lowest in the US.
For 2020, it was about 38 percent lower than the national average.

TAKE PKG
Monterey Park — just a few miles east of downtown Los Angeles with a population that is 65% Asian American — is known for its Lunar New Year festivals. 
This year… the year of the Rabbit which represents longevity and peace… violently interrupted by a lone gunman.
Saturday night, authorities say 72-year-old Huu Can Tran opened fire inside the Star Ballroom Dance Studio… killing 10 and wounding 10 others.
About 20 minutes later, investigators believe the same man entered a dance studio in nearby Alhambra — in an act of heroism, a group of people wrestled him to the ground and grabbed the weapon.  The suspect managed to escape, but their bravery likely prevented more casualties.
The massacre… a stark reminder of the many mass shootings that have left a scar on the nation.

Reporting in Monterey Park - Nic Garcia, ABC7 News.
Now we bring in ABC 7 News Reporter Tara Campbell -- live in the newsroom.
Tara you were out in San Francisco among the local Lunar New Year celebrations...
It's always such a festive time of year here, what was the feeling out there?
Yeah, JR a lot of mixed emotions out there today . . . this shooting in Southern Californian certainly taking a toll right here in San Francisco --- 
Nats
A somber celebration in San Francisco Sunday . . . in wake of the mass shooting in Monteray Park . . . just outside a Lunar New Year Fesitval.
 "You know today is Chinese New Year. It's suppose to be the happiest day of the year, but because of the shooting everyone has become sad."
 "You know it's bitter sweet, we're all suppose to be coming together as one to celebrate and a lot of families aren't able to on this day, it's been a really tough time"
From dumpling making . . . to dancing . . . 
Nats
 . . . determined to ring in the year of the Rabbit. 
 "It's sad to hear about it. We feel sorry for them, but we still celebrate because it's part of our culture."
Nats
In the heart of Chinatown . . . Mayor London Breed calling for prayers. 
 "So I just want to take a moment of silence for those families and those victims who lost ther lives to this tragedy."
 "I mean any day is bad, but today especially for on Chinese New Year for our Asian community. for our whole community, it's devastating."
Dennis Wu is Chair of the San Francisco Community Alliance for Unity, Safety, and Education. 
 "To wake up this morning to the shocking news of 10 people being killed in Monterey Park that is the only conversation that people are all having." 
The shooter's motive is still unclear . . . but hate crime or not . . . Wu says the message must be clear.
 "We're working on a float for the Chinese New Year Parade and the theme is we all belong . . .  and we do . . . all belong." 
And Mayor Breed says the city will be upping its police presence at Lunar New Year events over the next two weeks . . . and they're also stepping up patrols in Oakland. 
Governor Gavin Newsom was down in Monterey Park today... tweeting these photos.
He captioned them by saying in part, quote...
"The strength of this community is incredible.
No other country in the world is terrorized by this constant stream of gun violence. 
We need real gun reform at a national level."
President Biden issued this statement saying in part, quote...
"While there is still much we don't know about the motive in this senseless attack, we do know that many families are grieving tonight, or praying that their loved one will recover from their wounds."
The President is ordering all flags to fly at half staff through sundown on Thursday to honor the victims.


An outpouring of support for a community touched by tragedy... another deadly mass shooting.
J st like the rest of the community leaders at the state, county and local level are still shocked and trying to process the tragedy that happened here.
Now...in addition to offering emotional their support law makers tell me they're also looking into what they can do at the legislative level to help prevent another one of these tragedies. 
As the investigation into the tragic Half Moon Bay continues...the recovery is only beginning.
Assemblymember Marc Berman says just a day ago he was at a vigil on the Capitol Steps for victims in the Monterey Park shooting.
 now here we are 24 hours later, and I'm in my district in the community that's been impacted by a mass shooting. It's hard to believe. But it's it's but it's real. And it's real. And it's happening in communities all across the state all across the country. And it's absolutely devastating and senseless.
Berman, joined Governor Gavin Newsom and other leaders like State Senator Josh Becker, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo and more at ALAS.
ALAS, a nonprofit dedicated to helping the local Latino Community.
The organization providing support to those impacted by the shootings including those displaced by the investigation...many of whom are farmworkers.
 we have 1000s of farm workers here. And fortunately we have nonprofits that all of us are working with them
Right now local politicians like the communities they represent say they're frustrated.
 this instance, seems to be an instance of kind of workplace frustration. I know, down in Monterey Park, it was, you know, frustration with family and frustration with, you know, people that the gunman knew, that happens all over the world that happens all over the world on a minute by minute basis. But what doesn't happen all over the world is mass shootings. And so we in California, obviously internalize this. We need people across the country, we need our Supreme Court to really understand that it's in their hands to save lives.
Becker says that even though he's been part of successful gun legislation being passed...he plans to work with the Governor to look at any further action that can be taken.
 I think we'll be going back to the drawing board with him and seeing what else can we do on the largest scourge of gun violence?
A feeling echoed by Berman.
 If you look at the average gun death per capita in California versus the average state, we save 1800 at 2000 lives a year in California, that's a massive amount of life that is not lost. But obviously, there's still loss of life that's happening. And so we need to do more. And we need to figure out how to get guns out of the hands of people who are unstable and shouldn't have access to them.
It's worth repeating that these same lawmakers have been in this area specifically following the storms of the last few weeks...so this area has been hit so hard.
They're confident the community here is resilient and will move forward but of course the loss of life and hurt will remain.

Here's what we know as you wake up this morning...
Seven people are dead after the gunman opened fire yesterday afternoon at "Mountain Mushroom Farm" and "Concord Farms."

Time now for first focus - where we pick a story, or stories, and take a closer look at them....
today, we're discussing mass shooting in half moon bay AND OUR STATE'S GUN LAWS. 
 California has a reputation as a difficult place to buy a gun .
mainly because the state has been judged the strongest in the nation by the gun-control advocacy group Giffords.
california has mandatory waiting periods and background checks for firearms purchases. 
we are one of eight states, plus washington, d-c, that has military-style assault weapons bans. 
And in 2016, california became one of the first states to enact a red-flag law, which allows authorities to remove firearms from someone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.
We're also live in Half Moon Bay this morning.
Gloria Rodriguez is outside Mountain Mushroom Farm, with reaction from the community.

More gun violence impacting bay area communities this week
Multiple gunshot victims are recovering this morning after a shooting at an Oakland gas station, where one person was killed.
Police are investigating the shooting that happened yesterday, at a Valero Gas Station on Macarthur Boulevard in East Oakland.
There were no victims at the scene but officers found several shell casings.
The Department says seven gunshot victims self-transported to area hospitals.
No word yet on their conditions this morning.
Happening today.
A U.S. Disctrict judge will hold a hearing on the federal oversight of the Oakand Police Department, following allegations of officer misconduct announced last week.
The report prompted Oakland's mayor to put Police Chief Leronne Armstrong on administrative leave.
Yesterday, Armstrong spoke about the allegations -- and demanded he be immediately reinstated.
He claims he took appropriate action after an officer was accused of ripping the bumper off a neighbor's car... and then later fired a gun inside police headquarters.


The Oakland Police Department has been under federal oversight for 20-years.
Armstrong and his attorney claim the Federal Monitor took over the investigation -- as part of an effort to extend the oversight that was set to end in May.
Ultimately, the mayor will decide if Armstrong is reinstated.
In San Francisco a supervisor is sounding the alarm over what he is calling a "catastrophic staffing shortage" at the city's Police department.
During a board meeting, Supervisor Matt Dorsey is expected to submit a proposal to remedy the issue.
It calls to *match any recruitment bonus offered by another law enforcement department in Northern California.
San Francisco offers a five thousand dollar signing bonus for officers coming from another department and none for new recruits.
Dorsey's resolution will also fight to develop a plan for reaching a recommended police staffing number of nearly 22-hundred officers within four years.
The full Board of Supervisors Land Use and Transportation Committee will meet today to discuss and vote on San Francisco's plan to build 82-thousand housing units.
State officials have given preliminary approval to the housing element.
Green lighting the plan is just the start of what will be a three-year process of re-zoning entire neighborhoods to allow for multi-family buildings.
Over half of the new homes must be low to moderate income housing.
A tale of two bridges in the bay area.
Now... a big announcement for the golden gate.
It's getting federal cash for upgrades.
While the bay bridge is in more of a financial pinch... with supporters seeking millions to keep the light art installation on.
THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO'S 85 YEAR OLD GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, WITH 400 MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS APPROVED TO KEEP IT SAFE IN CASE OF THE BIG ONE.
MEANWHILE IN ANOTHER DIRECTION-- THE BAY BRIDGE IS EARTHQUAKE SAFE.. BUT THIS YEAR, THE LIGHT SHOW MAY GO DARK… 

 
THE PROJECT WOULD NEED TO RAISE ENOUGH MONEY BY MARCH TO MAKE THE LIGHTS BIGGER AND BRIGHTER WITH 48-THOUSAND NEW LED LIGHTS.
THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE NEW DISPLAY UP AND RUNNING BY DECEMBER.
This morning, there's still a major clean up effort and concern after the recent storms we've seen.
In  Orinda, one man's home has been deemed unsafe because it could slide down a hill.
Yesterday, he loaded the final boxes into his car... before heading to a friend's home... where he'll be for the foreseeable future.

We're learning new details about a shooting at an Oakland gas station that killed one person.
Investigators have identified 18-year-old Mario Navarro as the victim killed in that shooting.
Four others were shot, and three more were hurt in a car crash connected to the shooting.
It happened Sunday night at a Valero gas station during a music video shoot.
Oakland Police say about 40 to 50 people were there, when bullets started flying in every direction.
Police believe this was gang-related and they fear there could be more bloodshed.

 
Police and city leaders say they're doing all they can to stop the violence, but they can't do it without the community's help.
Supporters of Oakland's police chief LeRonne Armstrong are demanding he be immediately reinstatement to active duty.


The N-Double-A-C-P held a rally yesterday in support of Armstrong.
He was placed on paid administrative leave over claims he failed to take action on two department investigations.
The Police Chief refutes those claims and said he will keep fighting until he's allowed back on the force. 


The chief is accusing the federal monitor overseeing the department of creating a crisis to keep federal monitoring in place which was set to expire in just a few months after more than 20 years.
Armstrong's supporters are calling for an outside investigation in connection to that claim.
A judge monitoring the federal oversight in the case says he's disappointed after going through the report. 
According to the Chronicle, U-S District Court Judge William  Orrick said the report demonstrates "significant cultural problems within the department remain unaddressed."
He ordered the city to detail a plan to come into compliance with court-ordered reforms. 
The hearing was the first since Orrick made the misconduct report public last week.
Today, Vice President  Kamala Harris will travel to Southern California, to visit the community of Monterey Park, as that predominantly Asian-American community mourn the 11 people who died in last weekend's mass shooting at a ballroom dance studio.
The victims ranged in age from 57 to 76.
Nine others were injured. 
The accused gunman was disarmed at a second dance studio he went to, by the owner's son, 26-year old Brandon Tsay.
Following RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS, THERE'S A RENEWED PUSH FOR gun reform measures.
but there's question about how much california lawmakers can do.
HERE'S ABC7 News reporter Tim Johns. 
Court documents uncovered by ABC-7 News show.... the 66-YEAR-OLD year old suspect MADE THREATS AGAINST his roommate in 2013.
Tthe two had worked together at a San Jose Restaurant.
The documents show the ROOMMATE took out a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST Zhao AFTER HE allegedly TRIED TO SUFFOCATE HIM WITH A PILLOW  AND LATER THREATENED TO attack him with a knife.
We've learned that Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies were unable to serve Zhao with court papers in that case-- and that he never showed up to hearings.
A judge allowed the restraining order to expire.
SAN MATEO COUNTY's DISTRICT ATTORNEY says everything will be done this time around to fully prosecute Zhao.


D-A WAGSTAFFE SAYS ZHAO WILL BE CHARGED WITH SEVEN COUNTS OF MURDER, AND ONE COUNT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER, in addition to firearms enhancements, and a count of special circumstance allegation of multiple murder.

You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today... the Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park mass shootings have again renewed the call for tackling mental health as a primary way to stop mass shootings. But what does research really show about the link between the two? A Columbia University professor behind an eye-opening study will join us.
Also... even as San Francisco lags behind other big U.S. cities in pandemic economic recovery, San Francisco International Airport is doing just fine, thank you very much. Our media partner, the San Francisco Standard, will share the interesting numbers.
But first... just in just the past hour... the suspect in the Half Moon Bay mass shooting, 66-year old Chunli Zhao, made his first court appearance in San Mateo County court in Redwood City.
Zhao is charged with 7 counts of murder and one count of attempted murder
Yesterday, Governor Newsom visited the two farms where the tragedy unfolded, and met with some of the victims' families.
He was uncharacteristically emotional, after the two mass shootings in three days that took 18 lives, in a state that has some of the country's strictest gun laws.
A local leader who accompanied the Governor yesterday was State Senator Josh Becker, whose district includes Half Moon Bay and most of San Mateo County.
Senator Becker, thanks for being here with us today.
**Have you been feeling all sorts of emotions as well? Which part of this tragedy has hit you the hardest?
**We now have the names of the 7 who died. 5 Chinese 2 Mexican.


 What is the common thread? Do you have insight into why Zhao may have targeted those individauls?
**What were some of the victims' stories? Who were they?
**What kind of support for survivors and their families? Social services agencies providing food and housing?
**Having met with them yesterday and seen their living conditions... do you think these farm workers, making $9 hour, living in trailers using porta-potties and stoves outside... do you feel things need to change, as San Mateo County D.A. Steve Wagstaffe mentioned after the hearing this afternoon?
**are there services they should have now, whether it's health or mental health, that they don't have easy access to? 
**Many of these workers aren't U.S. citizens but they have visas to labor here and help produce the food we eat.... does the state of California have an obligation to ensure safety and wellness?
**California leads the nation in the incidents of mass shootings and the number of mass shooting deaths, despite having stricter gun laws than almost every state... longer waiting periods, more disqualifiers for gun ownership, smaller magazine capacity limits, etc. Some people say clearly, California's approach is not effective. Do you disagree?
**What needs to happen? Federal action? What specific action? The US has a gun homicide rate 26 TIMES HIGHER than our peers.
**Short of that, what else can the state try that may prevent, if not all, then at least some of them?
**the semi-automatic handgun zhao used... should that be legal?
**In Zhao's case, a Santa Clara County judge let a 10-year old restraining order expire without renewal... I assume he wouldn't have been able to legally buy a gun if that restraining order stayed in place? Did anything in process fall short there?
**Half Moon Bay is a small, quiet, tightly knit rural farm community amidst the hustle and bustle of our region... how can it heal after this?
We want to remind you, there are ways you can help in the wake of the Half Moon Bay mass shooting.
The Farmworker Caravan has put out an urgent call for donations.
Those will help 40 families that have been displaced because of the shooting.
If you'd like to donate, we have a link to their GoFundMe page on our website, ABC7 News dot com.
The "ALAS" group supporting Latino youth is also accepting donations.

A study delved into the mentality and mindset of people who commit mass violence. 
An analysis by The U-S Secret Service says most attackers suffered a major life challenge in the year before mass violence.
Many had displayed threatening behaviors. 
The secret service analyzed 173 attacks. 
Most of the attackers were white men... and nearly half had a history of domestic violence.
Another vigil will be held tonight outside the Monterey Park dance studio in Southern California where 11 people died in last weekend's mass shooting.
Nine others were injured.
The vigil will coincide with a visit by Vice President Kamala Harris.
She is expected to arrive in Monterey Park in just a few minutes.
Zhao's first court appearance was a fast one...coming just days after the tragic shooting.
Right now he remains in jail, the judge did not allow bail.
All of this just the start in the process to bring justice to the victims and their families.
 ( cgs AFTER here ))
The last time we saw the suspected shooter was in this video of him being taken into custody the day of the shootings.
Wednesday, is the first time he's been seen publicly since then...66 year old Chulin Zhao...using this yellow document trying to shield his face from the camera.
Zhao...who was assisted by an Mandarin interpreter, only spoke when the judge asked him to verify his name. 
 this investigation is two days old, there's an awful lot more to learn. 
San Mateo County District attorney Steve Wagstaff asking judge Susan Jakubowski to order no bail for the suspect.
The Judge agreed. 
 under California constitution, anytime somebody is a danger to the community, the court has the right to hold them in bail on any charge. This is the highest number of charges of seven counts of murder we have not had in San Mateo County before a case with one instance of seven murders at once. He is not a citizen of this country that has plenty of motive to run. For that reason, it was to me a very straightforward and simple request for no bail, 
Zhao who is a citizen of China had two attorneys appointed to him in court...the attorneys asking for more time to meet with Zhao and review the case.
Legal Analyst Steven Clark saying the defense, has their work cut out for them. 
 it looks like a very difficult case for Mr. Zhao, when you combine the witnesses, the fact that he went to the sheriff's office that he was found with the firearm and apparently made some very damaging admissions. 
Both Wagstaffe and prosecutors sharing a common concern in the case. 
 the defense attorneys have articulated to the court that they're concerned about the publicity up front, I am too, I want to make sure that for these crimes that occurred in San Mateo County, that our San Mateo County jury gets to hear it, we don't want to transfer it to another part of the state. 
Wagstaffe says this is the most deaths in a single incident in San Mateo County's history.
What led up to it, still isn't entirely clear.
Wagstaffe did not elaborate much on the motive. 
 we do have a feeling on the motive at this point, based on what he has told us. I'm not going into that. 
Wagstaffe did not elaborate much more on what steps his office will be taken but did add that they will be giving the defense attorneys a chance to present evidence to them.
He also said his office will be looking into the possibility of mental illness being a factor. 
 We have so many things we need to learn. And for me to say what I'm going to pursue now would be precipitous.
We are learning more details about the victims.
ABC7 news reporter Luz Pena spoke to the cousin and brother of three of the victims.
ABC7 News I-Team Reporter Melanie Woodrow read through the charging documents and is in the newsroom with more...
The 10 pages of charges are to the point -- 8 counts ... one  for each of Zhao's victims .. included one who survived. 
There are also enhancements which could impact his sentence if found guilty
Melanie -- The 10 pages of charges are to the point -- 8 counts, one for each of (Jow's) Zhao's victims .. included one who survived. There are also enhancements which could impact his sentence if found guilty.
The San Mateo County DA's Office tells ABC7 News it has a good sense of the order in which Chunli Zhao shot each of his victims.
The charging documents are laid out in the order in which the alleged offenses occurred.
10 chilling pages painting a picture of who Zhao allegedly shot first, second, third all the way through eighth.
Investigators say they were able to piece together the timeline based on a lengthy statement from Zhao himself along with witness
statements.
In addition to felony murder and attempted murder charges --
Zhao is facing enhancements for intentionally discharging a firearm and inflicting great bodily injury.
A third enhancement is particularly significant -- "Special Circumstance - Multiple Murder."
The San Mateo County DA says that enhancement makes Zhao if convicted eligible for life without parole or the death penalty.
"So we have a long way to go before we make that decision."
Melanie on camera - The DA many months .. during which they need to learn much more about (Jao) Zhao and his victims. In the newsroom, for the I-Team, Melanie Woodrow, ABC7 News.
The DA said making a decision on seeking the death penalty would take place over the course of many months. The DA also requested no bail for Zhao, noting the county has never had seven counts of murder at once before that that Zhao is a flight risk.
In the newsroom, for the I-Team, Melanie Woodrow, ABC7 News.

THIS IS WHERE THE SUSPECT WILL BE MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN COURT THIS AFTERNOON  JUST TWO DAYS AFTER A VIOLENT SHOOTING SPREE AT TWO SEPARATE FARMS  WHERE HE WAS BELIEVED TO BE TARGETING SOME OF HIS OWN CO-WORKERS.
BUT ACCORDING TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY COURT DOCUMENTS -- We're learning that the SUSPECT, 66-YEAR-OLD ""Chwen-Lee Jow"" MADE THREATS AGAINST A DIFFERENT ONE OF HIS WORKPLACES -- about ten years ago.
HE WORKED WITH A ROOMMATE AT A SAN JOSE RESTAURANT BACK IN 2013  AND THE ROOMMATE EVENTUALLY GOT A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM  AFTER HE TRIED TO SUFFOCATE HIM WITH A PILLOW  AND LATER THREATENED TO USE A KNIFE TO CUT HIS HEAD OPEN IF HE CAN'T COME BACK TO WORK.
The Sheriff's Department was unable to serve JOW with the court papers, he never showed up to hearings AND A FEW MONTHS LATER -- the judge allowed the temporary restraining order to expire.
BUT SAN MATEO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY STEVE WAGSTAFFE SAYS ON THE PROSECUTION LEVEL  IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY FOR THE HALF MOON BAY SHOOTING WHICH LEFT SEVEN DEAD.


AFTER THE SHERIFF CONFIRMED THE VICTIMS WERE A MIXTURE OF BOTH HISPANIC AND ASIAN RACES…. WAGSTAFFE SAYS AT THIS POINT IN TIME  HE DOES NOT ANTICIPATE FILING ANY HATE CRIME CHARGES BASED OFF OF THE SUSPECT'S OWN STATEMENTS TO INVESTIGATORS.
HE ADDED THAT WE CAN LIKELY EXPECT TO SEE SEVEN COUNTS OF MURDER CHARGES AND ONE COUNT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER FILED TODAY WITH SOME SPECIAL ENHANCEMENTS… AHEAD OF THE SUSPECT'S COURT APPEARANCE AT 1-30.

They're demanding Congress help pass a national ban on assault weapons and other gun safety legislation. 
Governor Newsom believes mass shootings in the U-S are directly correlated with the availability of assault weapons and large capacity magazines. 
They allow a shooter to fire many rounds without stopping. 
The Governor expressed frustration during a visit to Half Moon Bay... one day after he met with victims' families in the Monterey Park mass shooting. 


San Mateo County authorities say the Half Moon Bay shooting suspect legally purchased a semi-automatic handgun. 
There's no indication if he used an extended magazine. 
State leaders say large-capacity magazines and semi-automatic guns can easily be bought in neighboring states then brought into California.
Governor Gavin Newsom and other state leaders say more needs to be done at the federal level to stop these shootings. 
This as California has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. 
Jobina, what are they asking of Congress and how might it help?
There's a growing memorial in Half Moon Bay to remember the victims.
People have stopped by to drop off flowers and light candles.

 Items needed after the devastating storms passed through a week earlier.
 Hours later, word of a shooting.
 Jimenez says he called a farmworker friend who didn't answer.

 
The family of 50-year-old Marciano Martinez-Jimenez is sharing details about their loved one, killed at Concord Farms.

We begin in oakland....
Supporters of Oakland's police chief  LeRonne Armstrong are demanding he be immediately reinstatement.


The N-Double-A-C-P held a rally yesterday in support of Armstrong.
He was placed on paid administrative leave over claims he failed to take action on two department investigations.
He says he will keep fighting until he's allowed back on the force.

 Armstrong's supporters are calling for an outside investigation in connection to that claim.

The department of Justice is suing Google, accusing the Mountain View company of being too dominant in the online advertising market.


California is one of eight states that are part of the suit.
Google says the lawsuit quote "attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector."
The latest round of Google layoffs aims to eliminate about 16-hundred jobs across the Bay Area.
The company's layoffs will affect workers in Mountain View, Palo Alto and San Bruno. 
That's according to filings with the state Employment Development Department. 
Last week, Google notified its employees that it was planning to cut 12-thousand jobs worldwide, a 6 percent of its workforce.
Google's parent company Alphabet, also let go workers from self-driving vehicle company Waymo.
According to Tech Crunch, Waymo laid off workers on Monday.
Its unclear how many workers were affected.
The company is also expected to shut down its "Waymo Via."
That's the company's self-driving semi-truck program.

A rare fox has been spotted in the Southern Sierra for the first time in nearly 100 years!
A Sierra Nevada red fox was spotted four times last year near Taboose Pass, that's on the eastern edge of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park.
The fox is an endangered species and was thought to no longer exist in the Sierra range until some of them were spotted in Sonora Pass in 2010.
This one was seen about 100 miles south of that area.
The video shows the substitute teacher exchanging words with the student before grabbing and slamming him on the ground as other students watched in disbelief. 
The teacher then forces the student out of the classroom.  
According to the West Contra Costa School District prior to the incident the student had made a racial slur. 
This parent, Irma Beltran found the teacher's actions disturbing. 
The incident has rattled Richmond High. 
Today ABC7 news was given cell phone video of a gathering organized by the Black Student Union. They addressed other students denouncing the use of any racial slurs and also asking the school to ensure everyone's safety. 
Those who have been taught by the substitute teacher say he's liked by students.
The school district fired the teacher and issued this statement.  "The student is safe with their family, and our school and district are fully investigating the incident."

An investigation is now underway..
The Department of Transportation looking into whether executives engaged in the unrealistic scheduling of flights.
Southwest says its schedule was quote "thoughtfully designed" and there was plenty of staffing, but its computer system melted down.
Southwest canceled more than 16-thousand flights over the Christmas Holiday.
Our other focus....
Your food deliveries may be getting more expensive... at least in San Francisco.
A pandemic-era rule that only let food delivery services charge restaurants 15-percent commission... is set to expire at the end of the month. 
The city wanted to make the fee cap permanent...
But DoorDash and GrubHub sued.
The city reached a compromise-- to leave it up to restaurants to decide if they want to make changes to their contracts.
Now restaurants may be paying the food delivery services as much as 30-percent commission, if they want more visibility on the apps.
The Golden Gate Restaurant Association says restaurants might pass the costs on to customers.


The City's Office of Small Businesses is alerting restaurant owners -- to make changes, they must go directly to the "settings" in the delivery service apps.

Across the board in the Bay Area... community levels of COVID are dropping fast after another winter surge.
Thankfully, we fared pretty well with hospitalizations and deaths over that time.
But ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains why doctors are still asking people to use caution when living their daily lives.
Sometimes lost in the news of the world... is the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is still upon us.
It was at the forefront of many's thoughts when making their holiday plans... but not much talk since.
Why? Because doctors are saying we are in a much better place.
That decline seen here in Santa Clara County... our community levels of COVID are where we were last August and February when there was a more relaxed feeling.
But we are not yet in the low levels according to Santa Clara County Deputy Health Officer Dr. Sarah Rudman.
That's why Dr. Rudman is still wearing a mask indoors... especially with new data from the CDC showing more people are suffering from long COVID than before.
Along with masking... staying up to date with the latest boosters is also proving to be beneficial in preventing infection.
And today the CDC announced that boosters also cut your risk of symptomatic infection in half.
The goal is that similarly effective shots are given out on a yearly basis in an attempt to normalize COVID like the flu.
But until that happens... doctors still say protective measures are best to mitigate risk for now.
In Santa Clara County Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
Former president Donald Trump may be posting on Instagram and Facebook again soon.
Meta will restore his accounts in the coming weeks... with new measures in place to deter repeat offenses.
Trump's accounts were suspended in the wake of the January sixth Capitol attack.
He released a statement .. saying such a ban should never happen again to a sitting president. 
There are new accusations in the case of a Virginia teacher -- who was shot by a six-year-old student.
The district was reportedly warned several times about the potential violence...
And now, the school board has voted to fire the district's superintendent.
Parents and the teacher's attorney are outraged by what they call a pattern of inaction.
They say the school missed or ignored red flags...

 
The teacher who was shot says minutes before the shooting -- school officials refused a request to pat down the armed student. Teachers were told to wait because the school day was almost over.
She is now preparing to sue the district.

About one hour of video was released... and it is difficult to watch.
The two mass shootings have renewed the focus on what is viewed by some in the A-A-P-I community as a taboo issue.
Advice on how to address mental health.
History has been made by a California Peet's coffee shop.
Why it could be a prelude of things to come for the Bay Area chain.


First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
Dan, Ama, that video was released by the city of Memphis around 4 o'clock this afternoon. 
Prior to it being made public, various city officials warning of its gruesome nature. 
And, those protests springing up almost immediately afterwards. 
The ones in Memphis even trying to shut down some of the freeways there. 
No denying the hurt being felt across Half Moon Bay.
Part of the messaging tonight-- Togetherness will help the healing process.
We saw a collective effort by city officials, businesses, non-profits and interfaith organizations.
Many -- including residents -- sharing, there is just so much they did not know.


That pain, on full display Friday.
The healing process continues next Tuesday, with an afternoon memorial service, candlelight procession, and dinner.
Video of the vicious attack on Paul Pelosi at the Pelosi's San Francisco home last October is now public.  
The video . . . along with other evidence . . . was released today after a court...  ruled there was no need to keep it secret after being played in court last month.
And as ABC7 News Reporter Tara Campbell reports . . . the release of this evidence is likely to have a major impact on the trial of the suspect  David Depape. 
So many have been asking how they can pitch in and support the grieving town of Half Moon Bay and those affected.
Consider donating to "alas" ""uh-LASS"".

Developing news out of Half Moon Bay tonight, where the community came together to show its strength and support following the mass shooting on Monday that left seven people dead and another injured.
According to the San  Mateo County District Attorney's office - the suspect, Chunli  Zhao, told investigators he was angry over a one-hundred dollar equipment bill -- the last of many things that angered him.
Zhao claims the incident was not his fault - but was told to pay 100-dollars after a workplace incident.
But tonight was about the victims.
ABC7 news reporter Amanda Del Castillo joins us live from Half Moon Bay, where hundreds of people showed up for a vigil.
Amanda?
The Archbishop of the Archdiocese of San Francisco visited both shooting sites in Half Moon Bay today.
A service was held for the seven lives lost in Monday's mass shooting.
Archbishop Cordileone prayed with loved ones of the victims at both locations.
Community members also joined in today's events offering moral, and financial support to the families.
Some family members held up pictures and shared emotional words for the victims.
The Archbishop told ABC7 news today it provided some light during what's been a dark time.

 
Today's service was one of several public vigils held for community members--to honor the lives lost in this tragedy.
Besides the body camera footage, surveillance video also captured the kicks... punches... and baton strikes.
Five officers involved in this brutal incident have already been fired and face several charges.
It took 22 minutes for an ambulance to arrive after the officers announced Nichols was in custody.
There have been numerous protests in response.
ABC7 news reporter Tim Johns is following this breaking story and joins us live from the newsroom.
Tim?
Businesses in downtown Oakland weren't taking any chances tonight.
They boarded up their windows along Broadway from 12th Street to MacArthur. 
So far the city has been relatively quiet following the release of the Tyre Nichols video.
There is a protest planned for Sunday.
I'm Kristen Sze.
You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today... with many people wanting to lend a helping hand in the wake of multiple tragedies in California... from mass shootings to flooding... how can you tell if a fundraiser is legitimate? What are the signs of scammers? We'll talk with an expert from the Better Business Bureau.
Also ... the news has been heavy this week, but today is the kick off of the Disney100 Anniversary Celebration. The Walt Disney Company turns 100... and we'll take you the birthday bash at Disneyland with Bay Area-raised Disney blogger Gavin Doyle. 
But first ... America is on edge, waiting for the video release of the Memphis police beating that resulted in the death of  29-year old Tyre Nichols three days later.
The release of police body camera footage is expected one hour from now... it is something civil rights activists demanded, but also something that could potentially bring about  more anger and unrest.
A protest is planned for 5pm tonight in San Francisco.
Ahead of the video release, Nichols' grieving family today calls it a "savage" encounter.


Joining us live now is ...Oakland-based civil rights attorney John Burris..
**you haven't seen the video... what do you know about what it will show in terms of what really happened to the 29-year old driver who was stopped by Memphis Police after taking photos of the sunset earlier this month?
**how tough do you think it's going to be tonight processing the video. what range of reactions do you expect?
**Tyre's stepfather describes seeing officers kicking him like he was a football... but what really stood out to him was that out of maybe 10 officers, nobody tried to stop the beating. can you explain that? when it's one, it's easy to say one bad egg... but 10 officers not recognizing something very wrong is happening? Systemic? groupthink?
**some say it's reminiscent of the 1991 police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles... you represented Mr. King... do you see similarities?
**some police departments are beefing up and on high alert for possible unrest after the video comes out... are you concerned for what may happen?
**some point out because the officers are Black, this was not racist. how do you view that argument? or is anti-Blackness a cultural phenomen that cuts across racial and ethnic backgrounds?
**How might the defense defend the 5 officers charged with murder? What line of defense might there be?
**Rodney King, Oakland Riders case from 20 years ago, George Floyd, Tyre Nichols... how do we keep this from happening again? what specific reforms, training or hiring measures would you want to see?
**The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021... passed House, didn't pass Senate. Would that help? Does it have a chance now?

PAUL PELOSI CONTINUES MAKING PROGRESS IN HIS RECOVERY. 
REPRESENTATIVE PELOSI TALKED ABOUT THAT AND GAVE HER REMARKS REGARDING THE RELEASE OF THIS FOOTAGE.
LET'S LISTEN.


The video was released today after the San Francisco Superior court...  ruled there was no need to keep it secret after the video was played in court last month.
Paul Pelosi was attacked at his San Francisco home on October 28th ...
The suspect David DePape ""de-pap"" told police he was targeting then Speaker of the House Nancy pelosi.
ABC7 News Iteam REporter Stephanie Sierra is here with a closer look at that video.
Now at 5-- 
Investigations in Half Moon Bay.
We're learning shocking details about living and working conditions at the farms where a gunman killed 7 people.


The vigil planned for today as victims and their families find comfort in the community.
And Is BART going broke?


We  take a look at the future "worst-case" scenarios the agency is considering if ridership doesn't recover to pre-pandemic levels.
Good morning.
It's FRIDAY, JANUARY 27TH.
Schools in Memphis have been canceled today ahead of that video release.
The Nichols family says it shows officers beating Tyre for three minutes in an assault that their lawyers liken to the infamous 1991 attack on Rodney King.
During a vigil for Tyre last night, his mother said she could not bare to watch the video...
but she has heard it is quote "going to be horrific."
She's also called for protests to remain peaceful.


The five officers arrested for beating Tyre Nichols during a traffic stop earlier this month are facing multiple charges, including second degree murder.
            Nichols died at a hospital three days after the attack.
The officers have all been fired.
Attorneys for at least two of them say their clients intend to plead not guilty.
Happening today.
Cities across the nation are bracing for protests -- as the country prepares for the release of what is expected to be graphic video showing the beating and arrest of Tyre Nichols.
Five former Memphis police officers have been arrested and charged with murder.
Overnight, four them were released from police custody.
Jobina, what is Nichols' family saying ahead of the release? 
We've learned California Terra Gardens... previously known as Mountain Mushroom Farm... was the site of another shooting back in July.
San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe says the suspect and victim were both managers at the Half Moon Bay farm.
They lived in trailers there and had ongoing "work-related" tensions between them.
The DA's office says the victim was in his home when he heard the suspect banging on his front door -- threatening to kill him and his family.
The suspect fired a gun through the glass door.
Deputies arrested the suspect.
They say he smelled like alcohol, and denied shooting. 
The July shooting and the most recent mass shooting involved different people and different circumstances.
What they may have had in common was tension between employees at the farm.
Though an official motive in the most recent shooting has not been given... investigators say the suspect was allegedly taunted with an offensive nickname that may have fueled his anger.
This morning, there are growing calls for Oakland's police chief to be reinstated immediately.
Chief Leronne Armstrong was put on administrative leave last week after a report raised questions about his handling of misconduct cases.
But Armstrong say the federal monitor overseeing the department -- has created a drama to extend monitoring that was supposed to end later this year.
During the police commission meeting last night, members did not publicly address the situation and went into closed session for over two hours. 
However the public had plenty to say.

 
The commission scheduled a special session for next Thursday.
So many have been asking how they can pitch in and support the grieving town of Half Moon Bay and those affected.

This morning, there a serious concerns about the future of BART.
The agency's board -- sounding an alarm -- saying if more money isn't secured major service cuts could be on the horizon.
ABC7 News Reporter Gloria Rodriguez is in the newsroom with what we could see in the not so distant future.
BART says ridership is increasing .. just not fast enough. About 150,000 people are riding daily.. compared to 400,000 daily riders, pre pandemic. That's a problem considering about 70 percent of BART'S operating budget has historically come from fares.
BART'S Board of Directors- getting real about its financial future. 
BART has receieved $1.6 Billion in Federal Aid to help sustain service but the funding is expected to run out by 20-25. 
If that happens, the transit agency predicts potential consequences such as.. 
Fewer Trains.. 
Stations opening later and closing earlier.
Station closures and line shutdowns.
Also.. 
No weekend service.. 
Mass Layoffs.. 
and No BART service at all
ABC7 asking if that's a real possibility or just a scare tactic.

 
BART says it plans to asks the FEDs, even the state for more funding, even though the Governor has proposed slashing the budget for public transit.
BART says it may take the funding issue to the voters, as a transportation measure.

The city of Memphis releasing that video just about an hour ago.
It is indeed very gruesome, something that we've been warned about repeatedly from city officials.

It shows, in great detail, the moments shortly after Memphis police officers pulled over  Nichols' vehicle. 
An initial confrontation occurred between officers and Nichols, who ran away after the initial traffic stop -- a traffic the police chief has questioned.
Officers later apprehended him and another confrontation occurred that ultimately led to Nichols' arrest.
The video has already sparked protests around the nation, including right here in the Bay Area, which several local ones expected to take place across the weekend. 
 Nichols' mother, who saw the video prior to its public release, is calling for everyone protesting to do so peacefully. 
" RowVaughn Wells/ Tyre  Nichols' Mother"
"I just want to ask for prayers for my family, for this whole community, and I want to say to the five police officers that murdered my son, you also disgraced your own families when you did this. But you know what I'm going to pray for you and your families."


there's more than an hour of video... showing officers repeatedly pepper spraying Nichols... then beating and kicking him... while he calls out for his mother. 
President Biden has seen the video and tonight he is calling it "yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience every single day."

ABC-7 News Reporter Tim Johns joins us now live from the Newsroom with reaction to the video-- and the praise Memphis authorities are receiving today from Tyre  Nichols' family.
Body cam video released today in another high profile case--the Paul Pelsosi attack last October.
It's release comes after a San Francisco Superior court JUDGE ruled there was no need to keep it secret after it was played in court last month.
suspect David DePape ""de-pap"" told police he was targeting then Speaker of the House Nancy pelosi.
ABC7 News I-team REporter Stephanie Sierra is here with a closer look at that video.

The agency's board -- sounding an alarm -- saying if more money isn't secured major service cuts could be on the horizon.
ABC7 News Reporter Gloria Rodriguez is in the newsroom with what we could see in the not so distant future.

Plus comedian zach zimmerman joins us live and he's also performing...
And most important person in the world today involves some very involved... 49er fans...
Our other lead... the half moon bay shooting...
We've learned California Terra Gardens... previously known as Mountain Mushroom Farm... was the site of another shooting back in July.
San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe says the suspect and victim were both managers at the Half Moon Bay farm.
They lived in trailers there and had ongoing work-related tensions between them.
The DA's office says the victim was in his home when he heard the suspect banging on his front door -- threatening to kill him and his family.
The suspect fired a gun through the glass door.
Deputies arrested the suspect.
They say he smelled like alcohol, and denied shooting. 
The July shooting and the most recent mass shooting involved different people and different circumstances.
What they may have had in common was tension between employees at the farm.
Though an official motive in the most recent shooting has not been given... investigators say the suspect was allegedly taunted with an offensive nickname that may have fueled his anger.
So many have been asking how they can pitch in and support the grieving town of Half Moon Bay and those affected.
Consider donating to "alas" ""uh-LASS"".
This non-profit has been supporting the farmworker community since 2006 and has set up a Half Moon Bay Strong Fund.

Hundreds of people forced from their apartment building in Oakland due to a flooding on New Year's Day are *still not allowed to go home.
The Chronicle reports many of the families remain in hotels or with friends and family.
During yesterday's BART Board of Directors meeting, many residents called in, pleading for help from the agency.
That apartment building, the Coliseum Connections complex sits on BART property across the from Coliseum station.
Many asked when they would be allowed to return home.
Next week we're expected to learn when the Oakland Zoo plans to reopen.
The Zoo was closed New Year's Day after a sinkhole opened up on the main road to the zoo.
Today, Sonoma County is expected to reopen the Joe Rodota Trail after it was closed to clear an encampment and remove health hazards. 
The trail is an eight-and-a-half mile stretch connecting downtown Santa Rosa and Sebastopol. 
This is video from last summer when another encampment in the same area was cleared. 
Our media partners at the Press Democrat say multiple non-profits and agencies helped move nearly 30 homeless people to shelter on Tuesday. 
Governor Gavin Newsom's CARE court program, which requires mentally ill Californians to undergo treatment, is being challenged in the state Supreme Court. 
According to the Chronicle, multiple groups filed a lawsuit, arguing people with disabilities should make their own decisions about treatment.
CARE Court allows family, healthcare workers, or law enforcement to refer a person of severe mental illness for treatment. 
The county would then decide whether or not they will undergo mandatory care. 
The program, which was created to combat homelessness, begins in October. 
We're getting a first look at a pricey toilet that will be installed in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood this summer.
Two companies, including one called Public Restroom Company, are donating this modular restroom.
The project was supposed to cost 1-point-7 million dollars but the donation is bringing that cost down significantly.
The Recreation and Park Department still has to dish out 300-thousand dollars for other costs like landscaping design, permits and environmental reviews. 
With the leftover money from a state grant, San Francisco plans to add other bathrooms, including one at Precita Park in Bernal Heights.


Public Restroom Company is not allowed to *sell this bathroom in San Francisco because the company is located in Nevada.
It is one of 22 states San Francisco banned for its stance on abortion, LGBTQ rights and voting rights. 
But while San Francisco can't do business with these companies, they can get a gift.
A new law passed last month, is expected to make it easier for people to build their retirement accounts.
The Secure 2-point-oh act raises the age when retirement account holders have to start taking money out of their accounts.
The age for mandatory distributions rose from 72 years old to 73 years old, giving people's money more time to grow.
Another change included in this law -- starting next year -- employers will be allowed to contribute to retirement accounts of employees who are making student loan payments.. even if those employees can't contribute any money themselves.
THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT HAS INCREASED THE TAX CREDIT FOR MAKING ENERGY EFFICIENT IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR HOME.
HOMEOWNERS CAN SAVE UP TO 400-DOLLARS A YEAR BY SWITCHING TO LED LIGHT BULBS OR USING A SMART THERMOSTAT.
PURCHASING "HEAT PUMPS" CAN GET YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BACK IN TAX CREDITS.
SOLAR PANELS WILL GET YOU 30-PERCENT BACK IN TAX CREDITS.
MORE TAX CREDITS AND REBATES ARE EXPECTED TO ROLL OUT LATER THIS YEAR.
This morning, the country is bracing for the release of video showing the beating of Tyre Nichols.
that Video is set to be released later today.
Cities across the nation are bracing for protests... including here in the Bay Area.
A "Justice for Tyre Nichols" protest is already planned for 5 p-m in San Francisco.
All five former officers have been charged with second-degree murder.
In the state of Tennessee, second-degree murder is defined as a "knowing kill."
It's also considered a class A felony, meaning they could spend 15 to 60 years in prison. 
Four of those officers have been released from jail. 
The other charges they all face are aggravated assault, two charges of aggravated kidnapping, two charges of official misconduct and one charge of official oppression.
The attorney for Tyre  Nichols' family watched the body camera footage and describes what he saw...


Another attorney for the family, Ben  Crump, said the video will remind the country of the Rodney King case in the  1990s.
That case led to unrest and riots in the streets of Los Angeles for days. 
In a vigil held for Tyre Nichols last night, his mother and the rest of the family urged people to protest peacefully.

A change is reportedly coming to restrictions on gay and bisexual men donating blood.
According to the Washington Post, the FDA is proposing new rules that would allow men in same-sex monogamous relationships to begin donating... even if they haven't abstained from sex.
The change could be announced by the end of the year -- after a public comment period.
The FDA previously eased restrictions in 2020 -- allowing men who have sex with other men to donate -- as long as they hadn't had sex with another man in three months.
The FDA's advisory panel is supporting a plan to simplify COVID booster shots.
Under the proposal, COVID boosters would become an annual vaccination, similar to the flu shot.
I would also simplify the vaccination process.. by allowing one vaccine recipe for *all doses.
Right now, un-vaccinated people who receive their first shot get a vaccine targeted at the original COVID virus... and booster shots are formulated to combat variants.
The FDA commissioner would still have to sign off on the plan before it could go into effect.

Today, Quarterback Brock  Purdy will undergo a M-R-I.
He injured his elbow in the first quarter and left the game... but had to come back when 4th string quarterback Josh Johnson suffered a concussion.
The team is concerned the injury could be serious enough to impact the team for NEXT season.


At one point --  49ers great and hall of fame quarterback Steve Young joked on Twitter that he was "warming up in the parking lot."
The Niners ended up losing 31 to 7.
The Monterey Park Community in Southern California got a chance to say thank you to the hero who risked his life to stop a mass shooting last week.  
Brandon  Tsay ""SAY"" received the Medal of Courage from the city of Alhambra yesterday.
Brandon wrestled a gun away from the shooter who had already shot multiple people at one dance hall in Monterey Park.
He was on his way into a second location when he ran into Brandon. 


PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS INVITED Brandon TO ATTEND THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IN WASHINGTON  D.C. NEXT MONTH.
Dozens of people turned out at San Jose City Hall last night...for a vigil honoring shooting victims in Monterey Park...as well as two similar incidents here in the Bay Area. 
They paid their respects to those killed in Half Moon Bay and Oakland last week. 
7 people died when a disgruntled worker opened fire at two farm locations in Half Moon Bay Monday.

Happening today.
California Assembly Republicans and law enforcement officials are set to introduce a package of bills aimed at improving public safety.
According to the group -- the bills will focus on providing resources to law enforcement and victims of crimes.
The group will also demand what they call "real consequences" for crimes -- but they haven't explained what "real consequences" would entail.
Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin posted a message to fans in his first public comments since collapsing on the field in Cincinnati.
He sent a huge thank you to people for their unwavering support.
The Bills safety went into cardiac arrest during a game against the Bengals on January 2nd.
Hamlin collapsed and had to be resuscitated twice on the field.
The football star says now was the "right time" to speak since the Bill's season ended, and he's had time to recover.
He thanked coaches, teammates, and medical staff from the hospitals where he was in the ICU.

 
Meanwhile, Hamlin's charity "Chasing Millions" received over nine-million dollars in donations over the past four weeks.
We talk a lot about the efforts to get unhoused people who live on the streets a safe place to stay -- but what about people who are living in their cars?
Community leaders in the Half Moon Bay area are taking up that issue.
ABC7 News Reporter Gloria Rodriguez joins us live in the newsroom with the plan that's being put into action. 
Leaders are working on finding a spot on the San Mateo County Coastside where those who live in their cars can park.
It would be located anywhere between Montara and Half Moon Bay. 
The city of Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County and nonprofit WEHOPE are working to make this happen. 
We know of course that people live in their cars.. like in the video you see here. 
But Alicia Garcia.. Chief Operating Officer of WEHOPE.. tells me there is no safe parking program on the Coastside. 
They're looking to change that. 
Garcia tells me there would be a full-time security officer at a safe parking location where the unhoused could live. 
The City Manager of Half Moon Bay tells me there'd be bathrooms there, as well as showers and laundry facilities. 
Garcia says the parking location would help people experiencing homelessness get back on the road to self-sufficiency more quickly.


Garcia says it's difficult to help the unhoused when they're spread out and you have to find them. She says having them in one location helps meet their needs.. such as getting them comprehensive case management.. and helping put them in the housing pool for vouchers.
She says they got about 9-hundred-65 thousand dollars in funds for this.. including a grant from San Mateo County.
Half Moon Bay's City Manager says this can help the unhoused transition into permanent housing. 
Redwood City has a similar program for those living in RVs. The city's website says more than half who were part of the program.. are on the path towards permanent housing.
We're now learning that another Memphis Police officer is being investigated for his involvement in the "traffic stop" that led to the beating and arrest of Tyre Nichols.
The department announced today that it placed Officer Preston Hemphill on administrative leave shortly after the January seventh arrest of Nichols, who died three days later.
Unlike the five officers charged in the case, Hemphill hasn't been fired -- but has been relieved of duty during the investigation process.
According to his attorney, Hemphill was the third officer at the initial traffic stop--but wasn't at the site of the second altercation.
Nichols' stepfather believes Hemphill should be arrested, as well.
We'll have a live report from Memphis coming up at 11;30.
A verified GoFundMe page started by Tyre Nichols's Mother has already raised more than a million dollars.
The page was created FRIDAY, to assist the family with memorial expenses.
Some of the money will also go to the family's costs for mental health services and time off from work.
And for the construction of a memorial skatepark for Tyre.
IN the East Bay, A 28-year old Turlock woman is dead after being hit by a car in Ashland, near Castro Valley just after five this morning.

The 71-year old driver that hit the woman, stayed on scene and is cooperating with investigators.
The C-H-P is looking into why the victim had gotten out of another car shortly before the accident.
They don't believe domestic violence or drugs or alcohol were involved.
An Amtrak train is back up and running after it crashed into a car in Oakland this morning.

The first is the national COVID-19 emergency.
The second is the public health emergency.
But this change won't happen immediately.
Biden says these will last through May 11th.

Good afternoon
I'm Larry  Beil...

Our coverage begins with Spencer Christian and a look at the forecast.
Utility companies across the state are issuing a warning to Californians... prepare for higher bills.
This just in time for the Bay Area to see freezing temperatures in the coming days.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey spoke to PG&E to find out why rates are so much higher... and what you can do to save money.
California's trademark warm weather has really been anything but that in 2023.
Historic rain, now followed by freezing temperatures across the Bay Area is leading to higher than ever gas and electric bills according to TURN... The Utility Reform Network.
And unfortunately... PG&E tells us they're expecting a 32 percent increase to bills this winter compared to last.
Natural gas bills alone five times higher in California than benchmark prices in the U.S. last week.
PG&E Spokeswoman Mayra Tostado says the company does not control market prices for natural gas or electricity... supply and demand does.
Tostado says that means customers could see bills around 80 dollars higher than previous winters.
A climate credit from the California Public Utilities Commission is being voted on Thursday to provide some relief.
But TURN's Executive Director Mark Toney says the CPUC needs to consider other measures.
Until that time... energy savings expert Cyndi Bray says washing clothes in cold water and drying them on low and turning down your thermostat and water heater a few degrees can help people save money on utilities.
Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
California already has roughly 100 gun laws on the books. These recent mass shootings have now led people to ask whether they're working...and what more can be done?
It will come to no one's surprise that democrat and republican lawmakers have different answers to those questions. 
A recent study from the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that, compared to citizens of other states, Californians are about 25% less likely to die in mass shootings. Democrats say that's a reflection of our state's gun control laws.
in the newsroom liz kreutz abc7 news. 
Liz, what are some of the other gun measures democratic lawmakers are proposing and is there concern federal judges could strike it down?
That is a concern. Assembly member berman says he feels like he's working with one hand tied behind his back knowing that federal judges seem to be eyeing state gun laws. but at the same time, given the democratic majority, it's not hard for gun measures to pass in california. lawmakers are also looking at ways to expand awareness for gun violence restraining orders...and awareness around the potential dangers of gun ownership.
It's been one week since the mass shooting in Half Moon Bay. 
State lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are introducing legislation they say will help put an end to the violence we've seen recently across the state.
Abc7 news anchor liz kreutz is here with more on what lawmakers are proposing. Liz?

San Francisco has reportedly approved a resident's application to carry a concealed weapon, also known as a "C-C-W permit."
According to the Chronicle - this is the first approved application in the city since last year's Supreme Court ruling to remove some barriers to receive a permit.
Applicants must pass a background check, undergo a psychological evaluation, and complete a safety and qualifications training course.
Supervisor Catherine Stefani says she plans to introduce a bill that would expand a list of "sensitive areas" where people cannot carry guns, even with a C-C-W permit.

A New Mexico district attorney will formally file charges against Alec Baldwin for the deadly shooting on the movie set 'Rust'

In New Mexico -- involuntary manslaughter charges come with a potential 5 thousand dollar fine and 18 months in jail.

New developments in the nation's response to COVID-19.
Nearly three years after the first cases, President Biden is ending the country's COVID emergency.
ABC7 News Reporter Tim Johns spoke to local doctors about what this means for how we'll handle the virus going forward.
ABC News has obtained a copy of a law enforcement report from the Tyre Nichols case that contradicts the video of officers brutally beating Nichols.  
ABC7 News has made the decision not to show video of the arrest and beating because it can be triggering for many people.
That incident report comes from the Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff's Department.
It does not mention that Nichols was kicked and punched by the officers. 
The report suggests Nichols started to fight with officers and reached for their guns, pulled on their duty belts, and grabbed at least one officer by his vest.
 None of that is shown in the video, however at least two officers can be heard in the bodycam footage--after the beating-- claiming Nichols reached for their guns.

Lena.
Get ready to pay more to PG&E.
The utility company says many of our bills could be around 80 dollars higher this winter.
Lower temperatures and recent storms are leading to higher-than-ever gas and electric bills, according to "The Utility Reform Network."
PG&E says it's expecting a 32-percent increase to bills this winter compared to last.
Natural gas bills alone are five times higher in California than benchmark prices in the U.S. last week.


A climate credit from the California Public Utilities Commission is being voted on Thursday.
That could provide some relief.
Also, the CPUC will host a discussion about spiking natural gas prices and ways to mitigate those increases next Tuesday.

Despite the calls for stricter gun laws in California, a ruling last year by the Supreme Court has *loosened San Francisco's laws around who can carry a firearm in public.
The San Francisco Sheriff's Department has now approved its *first concealed carry permit since that ruling. 
And more are being processed. 
ABC7 News anchor Liz Kreutz joins us in the newsroom for more on what this means. Liz?
We've been reporting on how the current supreme court and some federal judges have been targeting state and local gun laws...making it harder for states to pass restrictive gun measures. This is an example of just that.
San Francisco has only issued a handful of concealed carry weapons permits over the past decade. But according to the sheriff's office, that's now about to change.
right now the sheriff says they have 72 applications in process for a  CCW permit. compare that to about 4 they processed in the past 10 years.
Now, once a person is approved for a permit, they will then have to complete a training program before the permit is actually issued. san francisco is also the only county in the bay area requiring applicants take a psychological exam as well. 
in the newsroom, Liz  Kreutz  abc7 news.

In the leaked report.... police claim Nichols was pulled over for speeding and reckless driving on January 7th...
which was not seen in the video.

An officer also claimed to be a victim in the report.

 The gun law in San Francisco is now loosening--after the U.S. Supreme Court loosened the eligibility requirements for a concealed carry weapons permit.  
San Francisco's Sheriff's Office says applicants no longer need to prove "good cause" to get a CCW. 
That's the permit that allows ordinary citizens to legally carry a firearm in public.
For years, San Francisco law made it nearly impossible to get one.

ABC7 News anchor Liz Kreutz is in the newsroom with more on what this legislation means. Liz?
This is the second attempt by Democratic lawmakers to pass this bill. In an unexpected win for gun rights advocates in California, it failed in the legislature last year.

Governor Newsom also said he expects a federal judge will overturn California's ban on assault weapons. this could happen in the next few weeks. The California Rifle and Pistol Association say they're expecting this as well, however, they point that even if it does happen it will almost certainly be challenged in court-- litigation that could take years.
in the newsroom liz kreutz abc7 news.
Liz, it's interesting about these "sensitive areas" lawmakers want to create where guns would be banned. How would it work if someone *wanted a gun at one of these sites?
Right, so let's say the owner of a private business or place of worship that was deemed a no-gun area *did want to allow firearms. They would be allowed to make that decision. They would just be required to hang a sign on the premises that says concealed carry license holders are permitted to bring their firearm there. The sign would have to be a certain size and design designated by the Department of Justice.

His mission is simple--J.J. Smith wants people on social media to see what those on the streets, hooked on fentanyl and other drugs, are going through. 
And so my journey with J.J. Smith began through the embattled Tenderloin. Born and raised in San Francisco and living in this neighborhood.
For J.J. Smith those "next days" often turn into weeks and months. He posts many of his interactions with drug users on social media to show others that compassion can bring understanding. 
Smith keeps an eye on many of them, as if they were his own kids. 
The success stories are few and far between.  
He assures me that most of them are not from San Francisco. 
Then there are those like 19 year-old Noah who have been lost to fentanyl for sometime.  He posted the time he sat Noah down to clean his face while he's nodding off. 
This hits very close to home because J.J. lost a younger brother to drugs back in October. The one thing he wants people to understand is that--you know how people say "You have to hit rock bottom," not with Fentanyl. 
one man is using "compassion" rather than "criticism", "caring" instead of "neglect", for drug users who struggle to care for themselves on the streets of san francisco.
and.. he's posting videos of his efforts on social media.
ABC7 news reporter Lyanne Melendez walked through the Tenderloin today with J-J Smith. 
Lyanne, his posts are getting a lot of attention. 
san francisco Mayor London Breed's been pumping the brakes on safe consumption sites citing legal concerns..  being that these sites are still illegal under federal law . . . last week however she introduced a possible work-around . . . calling on the board of supervisors to make way for privately funded sites. And while some say its the next right step . . . others aren't so sure. 
Jacqui Berlinn and her son Corey . . . the faces of city-wide campaign in Washington, DC. 
Calling on President Biden to enforce the federal law . . . and say "no" to safe injection sites -- the President's own son, Hunter, having battled drug addiction.
 "I'm appealing to president Biden as a parent."
Berlinn is the co-founder of Mothers Against Drug Addiction and Deaths . . . her son Corey
has been on the streets of San Francisco's Tenderloin for more than  a decade . . . now battling an addiction to Fentanyl. 
, We need to put our funds into prevention, treatment, and recovery, so my call to president Biden and his administration is to not allow for these drug sites in the United States at this time."
The drug overdose crisis is killing -- on average --  50 people a month in San Francisco . . . and some see safe injection sites as part of the solution. These are places people can go to use their drugs under supervision  in case of an overdose. 
Lydia Bransten is the Executive Director of the Gubbio Project. 
 "What we know about overdose prevention sites is that when people use pre obtained drugs they do not die." 
Vancouver, Canada, is home to the first safe injection site in North America . . . established nearly 20 years ago . . . it has overseen more than three-and-a-half million injections and reversed more than six-thousand overdoses . . . no deaths reported.
And despite being illegal in the United States. . . a nonprofit in New York City is operating two  privately funded — safe injection sites . . . a model San Francisco could soon follow.
 "We can put it up fairly quickly, but we want to do it correctly. We want to make sure that there are wrap services and that there is access as close as we can get to treatment-on-demand."
Mothers Against Drug Addiction and Deaths joining forces with nonprofits across the nation . . . to make the message clear. 
 "I think in the future there may be a place for safe consumption sites, but we need to build out recovery and treatment first." 
But Bransten says . . . there's no time to waste. 
 "Would it be perfect if we had everything lined up, yes it would  the fact that we don't should not stop us from saving lives today. 
Now there's still a long way to go here in San Francisco before safe injection sites could be a reality. 
The board of supervisors is expected to vote in favor of making way for the sites, but the city attorney still has to give it the  greenlight. 
Well, that's seen as another big barrier... under the New York model non-profits are going to have to raise millions of dollars for these sites... and speaking with Gubbio Project --- they say that's going to take time... so still a lot to sort out there. 
I did also speak with Supervisor Hillary Ronen... who introduced this legislation along with the Mayor... and she said ideally they'll get three sites up and running this year. 
Santa Clara County's mass vaccination and  COVID testing sites are closing at the end of the month.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains while testing and vaccinations are still available... this is a step towards moving into the next phase of  COVID response.
Three long years of  COVID… that's what Friday will mark in Santa Clara County… it's the date Public Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody announced the first emergency order here in the South Bay.
Today… county leaders announced a major shift.
One way they will do this is by closing all county mass vaccination and testing locations by the end of February.
The sites served around 30,000 county residents per day during the peak... and helped more than 90 percent of residents get at least one  COVID shot.
This announcement comes after President Joe Biden announced that the national  COVID emergency will end in May.
As some celebrate the sign of a "return to normal", disability rights activist  Charis Hill has concerns.
Hill takes three  immunosuppressive medications due to a rare disease called  spondylitis.
They want the disabled community to be alongside leaders when they make these major changes because their decisions put everyone at risk.
We asked Dr. Cody about this... and she agrees... and adds the pandemic is not over just because they are rolling back their response.
With  COVID wastewater data showing medium levels in the community... she wants people to still take precautions like getting boosted and wearing masks to be most safe.

We begin in san francisco as we kick off black history month....
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors will hold a special hearing next week on a reparations payment proposal.
The African American Reparations Advisory Committee laid out the proposal publicly  last month.
Among the ideas... giving 5-million dollars to each eligible person.
To qualify, residents would have to be 18 or older, identify as Black or African American on public documents for at least 10 years, and meet two of eight additional criteria.
Another proposal included waiving certian debts...


Our other focus....
We'd all love a 4-day work week.
The tide keeps moving in that direction.
Maryland lawmakers have now created a bill to offer incentives to companies that try out the idea.
The proposal would offer businesses in Maryland tax credits if they try out a 32-hour workweek for employees... without dropping their 40-hour workweek level of pay.
Employers would have to participate for nearly two years.
This is a first-of-its-kind plan in the U-S.
It still has a long way to go...
It must pass the state legislature before needing the governor's signature.

But first... UCSF's chair of the department of medicine, Dr. Bob Wachter, has made national headlines again with a new tweet thread on his COVID decision making.
He tweeted "Plan to wear a mask, likely forever"... referring to public transit, theaters and other large gatherings.
Joining us live now... Dr. Wachter.
**Before we get to your tweet thread... the big news this week... the White House says it's ending the COVID health emergency May 11th. You just talked with White House COVID coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha today... can you relay to us why this timing?
**California is ending its COVID health emergency even before that... by the end of this month... do you agree with the timing from the state and the federal government?
**And what does it mean, practically speaking, when it's no longer an emergency? No money for vaccines? No money for paxlovid? No money for tests? For the public, what changes? Will they have to foot the bill? Will prices go up?
**Did you talk to Dr. Jha about the vaccine strategy going forward? Yearly shot in the fall?
**Opinions of COVID measures run the gamut... some doctors say this is overdue by a year, but others are saying it's irresponsible for the government for ending the emergencies now... is there an objective way to decide which is true, or is it all based on your health and priorities?
**Which means us to your risk-based decision-making... your latest tweet thread got you in papers across the country saying "Dr. Wachter will mask forever"... and that's of course based on this tweet. Let's look at it again.
**You also tweeted that shopping for 30 minutes in a crowded Safeway is another situation where you'll likely always keep the mask on going forward. But where are you willing to not mask now?
**You also tweeted this picture of UCSF residents at a recent party... everyone's dancing, few are masked... some comments were critical... like this was too unsafe... what do you make of that?
**you continue to try to avoid it... mainly to avoid long covid? do we know any more about long covid today than we did 2 years ago?
**Is paxlovid prescribed enough these days?
**new study confirms there was a COVID baby bump in 2021... but there's some bad news in there. Record perterm births. What does that suggest?

We are approaching three years since the first cases of COVID were detected here in the Bay Area.
Now, we're moving from a pandemic emergency -- and learning to live with the virus.
ABC 7 reporter Lena Howland is live in the South bay with the changes coming this month.
This is the eighth time in a row the Fed has decided to raise interest rates.
They are really trying to balance bringing down inflation -- while not tipping the economy into a recession.
Consumer prices went up six and a half percent over the year long period ending in December.
That's a significant slowdown from a summer peak, but still more than triple the Fed's target inflation rate of 2-percent.


Prices are cooling.
But you're still paying about 10-point-4 percent more than a year ago for food.
The latest rate hike will mean paying more for your credit card.
The average household credit card debt is just under 65-hundred dollars.... which means you'll pay an additional 123 dollars in interest.
As the economy recovers from the pandemic, there is a new threat - the looming debt ceiling showdown.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with President Biden yesterday.
The White House says the President made it clear to McCarthy that they cannot allow the U.S. to default, which is not negotiable.

This time it's another quarter point.
Jobina has more on how this could affect your finances.

The sites served around 30,000 county residents per day during the peak... and helped more than 90 percent of residents get at least one  COVID shot.
This announcement comes after President Joe Biden announced that the national  COVID emergency will end in May.
As some celebrate the sign of a "return to normal", disability rights activist  Charis Hill has concerns.
Hill takes three  immunosuppressive medications due to a rare disease called  spondylitis.
They want the disabled community to be alongside leaders when they make these major changes because their decisions put everyone at risk.
We asked Dr. Cody about this... and she agrees... and adds the pandemic is not over just because they are rolling back their response.
With  COVID wastewater data showing medium levels in the community... she wants people to still take precautions like getting boosted and wearing masks to be most safe.

The Atherton City Council has approved a plan for more affordable housing, but with a tweak after a heated town hall this week. 
The adjusted plan, according to the Chronicle, includes a zoning overlay that allows single-family homes as an alternative on Oakwood Boulevard. 
Many residents including Stephen and  Ayesha Curry have voiced opposition, citing safety and privacy concerns. 
The plan, mandated by the state, calls for 348 homes to be built in the next eight years. 
The amount of housing is up to developers, but the city sets guidelines as to where they can be built. 
In Monterey County, the damage left by last month's storms will cost more than expected. 
County leaders originally estimated the damage to total up to 80-million dollars, but now they're saying may cost up to 125-million.
They're asking the state to help cover some of the cost. 
County leaders say it is possible the number could go even higher.

Twenty other charges were dismissed. 
Cal Fire says the Zogg fire was sparked by a tree falling on a pg-and-e power line. 
PG&E pleaded not guilty in June. 
Robots with the ability to use deadly force may be back on the agenda in San Francisco.
There was an uproar over the idea just a few months ago that got national attention.
S-F-P-D drafted a policy to allow lethally-armed robots to be used in "extreme" cases where violent suspects pose immediate risk to life.
Initially the robots were approved but the board of supervisors ended up blocking the policy.
During last night's police commission meeting, the idea was floated again.

 
There was no timeline given for when the proposal might be revisited.
California's snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains now sits at nearly double the usual amount for this time of year.
State officials say we are outpacing 1982 to 1983, which is the wettest year on record.

The snowpack is 128-percent of its April 1st average.
That's the end of season date when the snowpack is typically at its deepest.
Governor Newsom is backing a new version of gun safety legislation.
The bill would limit where people can carry concealed guns... ban anyone under 21 from getting a concealed carry permit... and require more safety training for people who do get the permits.

The legislation comes on the heels of the recent mass shootings in Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park, after which the governor vowed to take action.

The meters would be in effect seven days a week.. and generate revenue to help support vendors and parking maintenance.
Critics claim the cost of paid parking will limit lake access for some visitors.

Whether it will feel like that across the bay area today.
Good Morning.
It's Tuesday, February 2nd.
First let's check your  forecast.
Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.
Governor Newsom is backing a new version of gun safety legislation.
The bill would limit where people can carry concealed guns... ban anyone under 21 from getting a concealed carry permit... and require more safety training for people who do get the permits.


A similar version of the bill failed to pass last year.
The legislation comes on the heels of the recent mass shootings in Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park, after which the governor vowed to take action.
This is the eighth time in a row the Fed has decided to raise interest rates.
They are really trying to balance bringing down inflation -- while not tipping the economy into a recession.
Consumer prices went up six and a half percent over the year long period ending in December.
That's a significant slowdown from a summer peak, but still more than triple the Fed's target inflation rate of 2-percent.


Prices are cooling.
But you're still paying about 10-point-4 percent more than a year ago for food.
The latest rate hike will mean paying more for your credit card.
The average household credit card debt is just under 65-hundred dollars.... which means you'll pay an additional 123 dollars in interest.
As the economy recovers from the pandemic, there is a new threat - the looming debt ceiling showdown.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with President Biden yesterday.
The White House says the President made it clear to McCarthy that they cannot allow the  U.S. to default, which is not negotiable.

Former house speaker Nancy Pelosi will endorse Representative Adam Schiff for senate.
That's IF sitting senator Dianne Feinstein doesn't seek re-election.
In a statement obtained by the Chronicle -- Pelosi says Feinstein has her support -- if she runs.
However, the 89-year-old is widely expected not to run again.
Pelosi says Schiff quote knows "the nexus between a strong democracy and a strong economy."
This will likely be a high profile race -- with Schiff set to go up against Southern California representative Katie Porter.
Oakland representative Barbara Lee is widely expected to run as well.

We are approaching three years since the first cases of COVID were detected here in the Bay Area.
Now, we're moving from a pandemic emergency -- and learning to live with the virus.
ABC 7 reporter Lena Howland is live in the South bay with the changes coming this month.
Time now for first focus - where we pick a couple stories and take a closer look at them....
Today we're talking about the possible return of "deadly force" robots in san francisco...
And chat g-p-t has rolled out a new feature - but it will cost you...
We begin with the sfpd....
There was an uproar over the idea of the department rolling out "use of force" robots just a few months ago that got national attention.
S-F-P-D drafted a policy to allow lethally-armed robots to be used in "extreme" cases where violent suspects pose immediate risk to life.
Initially the robots were approved but the board of supervisors ended up blocking the policy.
During last night's police commission meeting, the idea was floated again by a representative from SFPD.

 
There was no timeline given for when the proposal might be revisited.
Our other focus....
The artificial intelligence chatbot that's just about everywhere these days... will soon be available by subscription.
Among its features... "Chat G-P-T" can generate human-like text based on inputs it's given.
The San Francisco-based company behind its "Open A-I", is piloting a 20-dollar monthly subscription.
People who subscribe to "Chat G-P-T Plus" will get priority access to the tool during peak times.
"Open A-I" plans to invite people to its waitlist in the coming weeks.
Are you ready for some numbers?
Reported estimates to run the chatbot is in the range of 100-thousand dollars a day... or 3 million dollars a month... 
CHAT G-P-T has had over 500 million users worldwide ... if just 1 million of those users subscribe - they'll gross 240 million dollars a year...
CHAT gpt has not confirmed its cost numbers.. 
An emotional scene outside of San Francisco City Hall yesterday -- as neighbors, city leaders and activists came together to take a knee, mourning the death of Tyre Nichols.
The group demanding justice.
Among them, San Francisco police chief Bill Scott.
Mayor London Breed spoke at the event, saying it's time for an honest conversation about race.


The group "Wealth and Disparities in the Black Community" organized the event, and demanded an end to low-level traffic stops, due to racial disparities in those kind of stops.
Tyre Nichols was laid to rest during a funeral in Memphis yesterday.
His mother, overcome with emotion and tears as she addressed the crowd.


Several dignitaries were in attendance, including Vice President Kamala Harris.
Speakers eulogizing Nichols continued to call on the federal government to commit to police reform.
A third lawsuit has been filed against former Windsor Mayor Dominic Foppoli, who's facing more than a dozen sexual assault allegations. 
According to the Chronicle, former reality TV star Farrah Abraham filed the lawsuit in December. 
She says Foppoli raped her at a wine tasting event in 20-21 in Florida. 
Abraham is one of 14 women who have accused Foppoli of sexual assault or misconduct. 
He has denied all allegations.
He stepped down as Mayor in May 2021.
There's a new setback in the plans to renovate San Francisco's Castro Theater.
According to The Chronicle, the Historic Preservation Commission voted last night to recommend a landmark designation for both exterior and interior features of the building.
That would include preserving he current seating arrangement inside the theater.
The seats have become a point of contention between the community and the theater's new operator.
Another Planet Entertainment wants to remove the current seating and replace it with a moveable floor and seats that would provide more flexibility for using the theater.

Suspended Twitter account users can now access an online form to request to be reinstated.
The company says appeals will be evaluated under a new criteria.

Twitter already started instating previously suspended accounts last year, including former President Donald Trump and comedian Kathy Griffin.
More than 30 million Californians received a middle class tax refund last year.
But now, some are finding out they may have to pay federal income tax on that money.
The payments range from 200 to 15-hundred dollars.
The state has been sending 10-99 forms to some people... but the I-R-S is still deciding if some people must pay taxes on it.
One agent tells 7 On Your Side - if the I-R-S believes the payments were meant for economic relief, they would qualify for a tax break.

 
If your payment was less than 600-dollars, you will not need to report it.

San Francisco police and the FBI are looking for a man who shot a gun several times inside a synagogue.
Surveillance video shows a man going into a room at the "Schneerson Jewish Center" in the Richmond District Wednesday night.
You see him shooting what appear to be blanks.
The rabbi says as the suspect left, he waved and made a reference to the Mossad - Israel's secret intelligence agency.


Police say the suspect matches the description of a man who flashed a gun at the nearby Balboa Theater earlier this week.
No one was hurt and the synagogue was not damaged.
President Biden has not announced whether he will run again for president in 2024... but we could get a first look at the themes of that expected run tonight.

This morning, job growth has far exceeded predictions for the month of January.
But that may not be such a good thing, with concerns over raising inflation.
From D-C, President Biden spoke optimistically about the higher-than-expected jobs report.

 
The unemployment rate is at the lowest since 1969, at just 3-point-4 percent.
But analysts say they don't want to see the number of jobs so high because that may add to inflation.
Feds have raised interest rates in hopes to put pressure on businesses to pull back on their spending, including on hiring.
To many economists right now, this job boost is signaling an imbalance in the labor market.

After more than four years... San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties are withdrawing a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration.
It was filed after a rule that would have instituted a wealth test for immigrants coming into the U-S.
Santa Clara County and San Francisco got a preliminary injunction that blocked the rule in October of 2019.
Since then, courts across the country sided with them.

Good Evening, I'm Ama Daetz.
And I'm Dan Ashley.
This is where we are talking about... the encampment on wood street in west oakland.. 
At its height, the camp was a sprawling complex of tents and shacks that housed up to 300-people.
It's been called a safety hazard.. with firefighters responding to hundreds of fires at the site.
But efforts to clear the site were barred by federal court until the city could provide alternate housing for the its residents.
And now as ABC7 news reporter Ryan Curry explains.. there is a place for those people to go.
Happening now, we're seeing a little break in the rain... but more is on the way.

One worker says they've been trembling since being back at the farm.
That same worker described in Spanish what they saw that day when entering the farm.

A new survey shows the economy and homelessness are two of the biggest issues state lawmakers have to battle this year.
The Public Policy Institute of California released the survey.
It finds seven in ten Californians view homelessness as a big problem in their part of the state.
The majority say the presence of unhoused people increased in their communities last year.

 
The survey also finds Californians are paying close attention to job growth and inflation.
It comes as large tech companies are laying off thousands of workers, which has many worried that more cuts will come.

THE RABBI OF THIS SYNAGOGUE TELLS US  BASED ON WHAT THE SUSPECT WAS SAYING  HE IS ADAMANT THIS WAS A HATE CRIME… AND IT'S ROCKED THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO ITS CORE. 
TAKE A LOOK -- surveillance video shows... on  wendesday night.. a man enters the room INSIDE OF THE  schneerson  jewish center... racks his gun... and fires off several rounds.   
Many believe the suspect shot blanks... since no one was injured. He says the reason people were slow to react  was simply because they were stunned. 
The small synagogue serves mostly Russian speaking  jews. 
Rabbi KHAN  NU - KOV left just before the suspect came… He says  as the suspect leaves  he waves and made reference to the  mossad  Israeli's secret intelligence agency.


In a statement to  ABC7 News... the  san Francisco police department says the suspect matches the description a man who flashed a gun at the nearby Balboa theater earlier this week.   
The rabbi says they only notified police on Thursday morning because those who were at the synagogue Wednesday night feared retaliation. 
AS POLICE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR THE SUSPECT  THE center plans to beef up security for  Shabbat, or the Jewish  sabbath, which begins at sunset TONIGHT and runs through Saturday. 
LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO, LENA  HOWLAND,  ABC7 NEWS
New developments in the death of a famed San Francisco private investigator.
Murder charges against two men accused in his death have been dropped.
76-year old Jack  Palladino died from a fall in front of his  Haight- Ashbury home in January of 2021 - after an encounter with two men who allegedly tried to steal his camera.
Turns out, the primary witness in the case, never actually saw what happened.
The revelation about the witness surprised  Pallodino's longtime friend and private investigator Jack  Immendorf.


The men charged in the case spent two years in jail while awaiting trial.
We're told one has now been released, the other is still in custody.
After more than four years... San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties are withdrawing a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration.
It was filed after a rule that would have instituted a wealth test for immigrants coming into the U-S.
Santa Clara County and San Francisco got a preliminary injunction that blocked the rule in October of 2019.
Since then, courts across the country sided with them.
But now, a deputy county counsel with Santa Clara County says the lawsuit is no longer needed.

 
Local organizations say the hope now is that there can be added focus on advocacy and resources for immigrant communities.

Homeless advocates and the city of Oakland will take part in a hearing today.
It's about the ongoing debate around homeless encampment sweeps.

The meters would be in effect seven days a week and generate revenue to help support vendors and parking maintenance.
Critics claim the cost of paid parking will limit lake access for some visitors. 
A step forward in the effort to redevelop the Oakland Coliseum complex. 
Yesterday, "the African-American sports and entertainment group" announced it has signed an agreement to begin exclusive negotiations with the city, to buy out its share of the site.

Under the plan, the group would keep the Coliseum arena, in hopes of drawing a W-N-B-A team, as well as concerts and events.
The group has also expressed interest IN THE PAST OF bringing an N-F-L team back to Oakland.
It now has two years to work out a deal with the city, which co-owns the site with the A's.

These positions will be filled by prosecutors and investigators WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, sheriff's deputies, police officers AND federal law enforcement.
The first of its kind task force in the Bay Area aims to dramatically increase the number of seized guns.
One of those gun laws is the red flag law... a court restraining order designed to remove both illegal and legal guns from people who make threats to themselves or the community.
We often learn that suspects in mass shootings have been previously labeled as threats... 
County Supervisor Cindy Chavez says the county hasn't prioritized using red flag laws enough.
So with more help from the community reporting these threats... she hope this task force expansion can lead to expedited restraining orders and more saved lives.
In the hopes that this doesn't happen again.

Developing news in the battle against the drug overdose crisis.
San Francisco is staring down *safe consumption sites as a possible part of the solution.
But will it be the thing that can finally prove to be effective here.
ABC 7 News Reporter Tara Campbell reports.
 "The bottom line is we're sick of talking about this. We've been talking about it for years."
Supervisor Hillary Ronen  is talking about safe consumption sites . . . places people can go to use their drugs under supervision in case of an overdose . . .  and get connected to treatment and other services   . . . 
The Board of Supervisors . . . says the sites could be part of the solution to San Francisco's drug overdose crisis . . ..
 "The city would pay for the majority of services in a center like that. 
. . . but legal concerns are slowing them down.
 "What the city wouldn't pay for is the staffing of the room that is watching people to make sure they don't overdose when they use drugs because under federal law that is still illegal."
And so they're turning to nonprofits to take the legal risk. . . 
Lydia Bransten is the executive director of The Gubbio Project. 
 "I do believe when it comes to life-saving services you need to take a stand."
And Bransten says in order to do that . . .they need time to raise the funds and a contract with the city - clearly laying out what they're paying for... and what they're not. 
Bransten estimates it will cost nearly one-and-half million dollars a year to operate a single safe consumption site.
 "That would include having staff, the equipment that we need, and also making sure we have EMT's on site." 
A nonprofit in New York City has been operating two privately-funded sites for more than a year -- and so far --- the DOJ's turned a blind eye . . . but there's concern that could change.
 "What's standing in between the city opening these centers, and not, is the City Attorney's Office." 
The City Attorney's Office *has signaled support for the New York model . . . but Supervisor Ronen says it's taking too much time.
 "When we get down to the details they say they won't sign off on contracts and they won't allow us to use opioid settlement funds for the purpose, so it's a lot of yes and no at the same time."

It's in response to the mass shootings in Half Moon Bay and in Monterey Park.
The Board will then vote Tuesday on the proposal.
It willl allocate a million dollars to hiring nine more people for the strike team.
Its goal is to take illegal guns off the streets -- and keep dangerous people from ever possessing a firearm.
Santa Clara County is the first in the Bay Area to have a dedicated gun violence team. 
Happening Tomorrow... as part of Black History Month Good Morning America is taking a closer look at the topic of reparations in California.
In the late 19-50's... an East Bay neighborhood called "Russell City" was grouped to be within the city limits of Hayward.
Russell City would then be turned into an industrial park.
About 14-hundred  black and Latino families called it home.
According to The New York Times, the newly-created California reparations task force released a preliminary report last year identifying five areas that may be eligible for reparations.
Russell City is one of them.
ABC News Senior National Correspondent Steve Osun-sami spoke to a woman whose family used to call Russell City home.

The new calls today to reinstate Oakland's police chief...
and new details about an officer shot over the weekend in the south bay ... the surveillance video and why officials are calling the suspect a "stalker"
Good afternoon
I'm Larry  Beil...
And I'm Kristen  Sze...
We'll have more on those stories in just a few minutes ... but first...
If you've looked at your gas and electric bills recently - you know prices are skyrocketing.
Nationwide natural gas prices are down - on average it's about two-dollars and 80-cents per million BTU ... but in California that number is closer to 20-dollars!
That's a 600-percent premium!
Just yesterday Governor Newsom called for an investigation into the recent price spike.
and today the California Public Utilities Commission or CPUC, held a special hearing to try to figure out why prices keep going up. 
ABC7 news reporter Leslie Brinkley tracked it all.  
Why are natural gas prices so high? Simple question with complicated answers. The CPUC convened a virtual panel of utility and energy experts to troubleshoot the spike so that it doesn't happen again in subsequent winters. The four hour meeting included only 15 minutes of public comment, like this resident. 
Some blamed the CPUC  for not controlling prices. But most experts blamed the wintery weather. 
California imports 90% of it's natural gas. Pipeline constraints certainly contributed to the price spikes but PG&E executives said patterns didn't indicate a need to inject more gas into storage. 
The CPUC made no decisions after hearing all the theories. Governor Newsom sent a letter to the federal government yesterday imploring them to investigate the wholesale pricing of natural gas in California for possible price manipulation. But short of that, customers are left to foot big bills although an accelerated California Climate credit of approximately $100 could be appearing on statements going out in March.
 I'm Leslie Brinkley ABC7 news.
We have new details about a shootout involving san jose police... 
Today, the chief said the shooter had stalked officers prior to the shooting.
The chief and mayor both spoke about last weekend's shootout that left an officer injured.
Police released these pictures and  video.
They say it appears Noe "" no-ee "" Orlando Mendoza, of San Jose, was spotted parked near two police stations.... and followed two police cars hours before the gun battle.
Investigators say Mendoza then used a ghost gun to shoot at officers during a traffic stop.
Police returned fire. 
They chased the shooter to a home where more shots were exchanged... and they say Mendoza surrendered. 
One officer was shot in the hip during that exchange.
Chief Anthony Mata says the violence has shaken his department.




The Chief says Mendoza had 14 prior misdemeanor convictions... none in the Bay Area.
The fentanyl crisis continues to claim the lives of those who are using the dangerous drug and leaders in the South Bay want to stop overdoses at the source.
This after three people died of what appears to be a fentanyl overdose in unincorporated Gilroy yesterday.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains how Santa Clara County leaders are responding.
The fentanyl crisis continues to claim the lives of those who are using the dangerous drug and leaders in the South Bay want to stop overdoses at the source.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains how Santa Clara County leaders are responding to the deadly crisis.
On a small town road in unincorporated Gilroy yesterday... the deadly opioid crisis reared it's head once again.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies found four men in their fifties unresponsive... likely from fentanyl use.
Sergeant Russell Davis says fentanyl is the most dangerous drug in the country right now and stopping this crisis remains their top priority.
Part of that effort comes in finding out how these men got the fentanyl in the first place.
We spoke with a group of friends at the home who said they were going to visit one of the victims in the hospital.
They declined to speak on camera... but they told us the fentanyl crisis is truly getting out of hand.
Santa Clara County leaders on the Fentanyl Working Group like Dr. Rachel Sussman agrees... especially when it comes to youth drug use.
And yet... Dr. Sussman says they are dying from drugs more than ever before.
Sussman says the Fentanyl Working Group has made strides in reactionary measures like having narcan more readily available.
But she says the next step is preventing overdoses before they happen.

In the East Bay ... supporters of embattled police Chief LERONNE ARMSTRONG ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING for him to be reinstated.
OAKLAND MAYOR SHENG THAO SAYS THIS IS STILL A PERSONNEL MATTER. 
              A-B-C 7 REPORTER RYAN CURRY SPOKE WITH SUPPORTERS WHO WANT THE FEDERAL OVERSIGHT MONITOR TO STEP DOWN.
This afternoon santa clara county supervisors are set to vote on whether to add nine members to the county's gun violence task force.
Those members would include staff from THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, sheriff's deputies, police officers AND federal law enforcement.
The goal is to better enforce California's red flag law, which blocks people from owning firearms if they have prior gun violence or domestic abuse incidents.
More job cuts in the tech industry.
San Jose-based Zoom today announced it's cutting 15-percent of its workforce.
That's about 13-hundred jobs.
In a blog post, C-E-O Eric Yuan said adjustments are needed after the company's large growth during the pandemic.
Yuan said he is cutting his salary by 98-percent ... and reducing the executive leadership team's salaries by 20-percent for the coming fiscal year.


In January alone, there were about 50-thousand job cuts in the tech industry.
Just yesterday Dell added to that - cutting 66-hundred jobs.
Now to a dangerous Tik Tok trend that's made its way to the Bay Area.
San Mateo County Sheriff's deputies say teens are shooting gel beads at people on the street in San Carlos.
It is connected to a TikTok challenge ... where teens shoot at unsuspecting victims and post it to social media.
Sergeant Acosta of San Mateo County Sheriff's office says it's not only dangerous for the victim - but even the shooters can put themselves in danger. 


Police are encouraging parents to talk to their children about the risks and consequences.
Teens could face a misdemeanor or a felony...
and a civil lawsuit could even be filed against the minor's parents.
Another building at U-C Berkeley is being stripped of its name... because its namesake was a racist.
Today workers removed the name "Moses Hall" from the building that houses the Department of Philosophy and Institute of Governmental Studies.
It had been named after Bernard Moses, a prominent faculty member from 1875 to 1911.
The decision comes after a review of his work noted intense racist and colonialist views.
It's the fifth building to be un-named at Cal since 20-20.
The building will be called "Philosophy Hall" for the time being.
An Alameda County Sheriff's deputy who crashed his motorcycle on I-580 is going to be OK.

The Sheriff says the deputy's injuries are minor.
There is no word yet as to how the crash happened.
There's a massive backup right on highway four in the East Bay, due to a crash in Antioch.
This is video from sky seven about 45 minutes ago-- it appears one vehicle is badly damaged and may have caught fire on the off ramp to Contra Loma Boulevard

ABC7 News Reporter Lena    Howland JOINS US LIVE IN SAN CARLOS WITH THE WARNING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT  LENA?
The White House says President Biden is "incredibly optimistic" ahead of tonight's speech.
The president is expected to tout a strong economy on the heels of a better than anticipated jobs report.
He plans to make the case that his policies have helped boost job growth, and reduced the unemployment rate to the lowest level in 53 years.
But the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll shows voters are concerned about the economy.
Four out of ten Americans say they feel worse off financially since President Biden took office.


The President is facing an uphill battle as he navigates a divided Congress.
The Republican House majority is ready to question him about everything from the growing tensions with China, decisions on Ukraine, and the effort to raise the nation's debt ceiling.
Some special guests will be in attendance.
That includes the parents of Tyre Nichols - the man who was beaten to death by Memphis police.
Paul Pelosi - following the violent attack on him last year.
Brandon Tsay - the hero of the Monterey Park shooting.
And Bono - for his work on poverty and AIDS.
President Biden will deliver one of the biggest speeches of his presidency today.
He's putting the final touches on his State of the Union address.
Jobina has more on what we can expect in tonight's speech.
You can watch President Biden deliver his State of the Union address tonight, right here on  ABC7.
Live coverage begins at 6 p-m.
Happening today.
The state public utilities commission will hold a hearing to discuss the recent high price for natural gas and electricity.
It comes as Governor Newsom calls for a federal investigation into the increase that so many of you have seen on your bills.
Energy experts say HIS CALL to investigate the issue IS A GOOD ONE.


Today's meeting is expected to explore the recent price increase... and possible protections for ratepayers.
For a list of resources to help when it comes to these winter storms - go to   abc7 news dot com slash take action.
You can find sandbag locations, warming centers, shelters as well as where to go for assistance.
Happening today, a vote to drastically increase the size of Santa Clara County's gun violence task force.
The Board of Supervisors is expected to increase funding for the first of its kind team by one million dollars.
It will allow the team to grow from five members... to 23.

 
The new positions will include prosecutors and investigators WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, sheriff's deputies, police officers AND federal law enforcement.
The goal is to increase the number of seized guns by better enforcing California's red flag law, which blocks people from owning firearms if they have prior gun violence or domestic abuse incidents.
This comes as President Biden undertakes a new push to ban assault weapons.
A new ABC News / Washington Post poll finds support for a national assault weapons ban is plummeting among Americans.
51 percent oppose the ban currently with 47 percent supporting it.
That reflects a 9-point drop in support, and a 10-point rise in opposition, since last measured by ABC news in September 2019.
The impacts from the recent series of winter storms are still being felt by property owners throughout the Bay Area.
Some local businesses say they're being left behind because they don't fit into the right categories for federal assistance...
or if they do, the amount they are eligible to receive isn't anywhere near enough to rebuild.
That's why Senator Alex Padilla says he's introducing two bills to give the federal government more flexibility in how disaster aid is distributed.

 
Experts estimate "insured losses" could add up to more than 500-million dollars.

Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.

President Biden is expected to highlight his efforts to fight inflation, improve infrastructure, and create jobs.

According to the Chronicle, the Housing and Community Development division rejected Oakland's road map, just days after the city council passed it.
The report says the state rejected the housing plans for majority of Bay Area cities, including Berkeley's, just last week.

A FIERY PRESIDENT BIDEN WRAPS UP HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS... IN WHICH HE TOOK AIM AT THE ECONOMY, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, BIPARTISAN POLITICS, AND BIG TECH.
i'm ama daetz.

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF ABC7 NEWS.
Thanks for joining us tonight!
[AMA]]
Joining us now is recently retired Bay Area Congressmember and ABC7's new political analyst, Jackie Speier.


She is here to discuss tonight's State of the Union address.
**You've been through a few state of the unions. What is it like in the chamber and what can you share about President Biden?
**There's a lot to cover, it felt like there was a theme tonight. The President really leaned into economic issues--particularly infrastructure and jobs.
**One thing we noticed not only when he talked about adding jobs he really seemed to be pushing "made in America."
**It felt at times as though the President was talking directly to the Republicans. Does it go anywhere when it comes to legislation?
**The President seemed to relish the boos he got from Republicans when he brought up former President Trump. But perhaps the big moment is when he suggested some republicans want to sunset medicare and social security. It felt calculated.... take a listen.


**While we're talking about medicare and health, the President hit on prescription drug and singled out insulin. This felt like a rallying point for him.
**He seemed to draw a reaction when he talked about tech, specifically social media companies and holding them accountable. Is change on the horizon?
 **Another moment came when the President addressed what happened to Tyre Nichols and called for police reform. How realistic is his call for sweeping reform, we've heard it before.
**The President when he talked about China and did not once say "balloon" but seemed to make it clear where the administration stands. He even got a "U-S-A" chant at the end. This felt like he was being extremely careful in addressing what is a highly sensitive issue between the two countries.
**You have been through this many times with multiple presidents. What are your key takeaways from tonight's address and what is the reality of seeing legislation actually move through Congress?
California Republicans were closely watching President Biden's speech tonight.
For more on their perspective ...
we want to bring in state Assembly member James Gallagher, who leads California's Assembly Republican Caucus.
**Watching tonight's speech, it seemed like the president's comments on the economy got the most animated reaction. Is the greatest partisan divide over the economy?
**The president seemed to try to appeal to blue collar workers -- that he's doing the job they hired him to do. What is your response to that?
**There were also tense moments in the chamber tonight when the president said some Republicans want to "sunset" Medicare and Social Security. Some stood up to shout "no" ... Majorie Taylor Greene even shouted "liar." What is your response to the president's comments?
**What is the counter messaging from Republicans? What is the GOP about right now?
**Let's look ahead to 2024. Will the party stand with former president Donald Trump? Or move away from him?
And, Tim, I've got to ask you, a lot of topics there covered by the President tonight.
Did he receive any pushback during any points of his speech?
Yeah, he did actually a few times.
At one point several Republican members shouted back at him about the crisis at the border.
But I think the biggest one came when the President said that several GOP members wanted to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare. 
That prompted some members like Marjorie Taylor Greene to shout "liar" at the president.

There's been dozens of covid cases despite 80-percent of Marin kids five through 11 being vaccinated.
Last week, 53 cases were reported throughout all Marin Elementary schools. 
The Marin County Office of Education says this is to be expected...

 
There's been cases at some middle and high schools, but there's no outbreak among the older students.
Health officials say they aren't worried about a spread since covid in waste water is declining.
It was just a couple of weeks ago BART warned it could be in a dire financial situation soon... and now Muni is also sounding the alarm.

Concern is growing in San Francisco over a new synthetic  opioid showing up on city streets that's 20 times more powerful than  fentanyl.
The drug is called Isotonitazene "" ISO-  Tah-  Nite-  ah- Zeen"" ... or ISO for short.
Dealers are reportedly slipping ISO into other illicit drugs -- its apparently showing UP IN D-E-A labs, mixed with heroin and  fentanyl, or pressed into counterfeit prescription pills. 
San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey calls the revelation troubling and has sent an alert to the Medical Examiner's office.


Dorsey also wants to make sure that the medical examiner has the ability to test for the drug *retroactively, as well.
He says tracking the drugs causing accidental overdoses is the key in combating the crisis. 
The man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi appeared in court today.
The Government told the judge 16-thousand pages of evidence have been prepared.
This includes body cam video, surveillance footage, and F-B-I forensic results.
Authorities are also waiting for the release of suspect David DePape's hard drives and devices.
DePape will likely go to trial in the state first before a federal trial ...due to state jurisdiction.
His next federal court date is March 15th.
Also today...The House of representatives voted to stop the covid vaccine mandate for foreign travelers coming into the country.
This is one of the few restrictions still in place from the pandemic.

At least one county supervisor is making a push to create a red-light district in the city.
Some residents in The Mission say sex trafficing problems are as bad as they've ever seen it. 
Now an aide to SUPERVISOR HILLARY RONEN says Ronen is backing a plan to create a so-called "Red Light District"... an area of the city where sex work would be allowed.  


THERE'S NO SPECIFIC PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE FOR NOW... AND NO SPECIFIC LOCATION TARGETED. 
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS IDEA HAS BEEN CONSIDERED IN SAN FRANCISCO.
IN 2008, THERE WAS A BALLOT PROPOSITION TO DECRIMINALIZE PROSTITUTION.
THAT PROPOSITION FAILED.

You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today... the Bay Area is losing residents... as people move away during the pandemic, often times driven by the high cost of living. But nowhere is that more acute than in Marin County. A researcher who studies population change will join us to explain why that's happening, and why it's a concern.
Also ...ABC7 is proud to again sponsor this year's SF Pride Parade... organizers will join us to unveil some important changes as the tradition enters its 53rd year.
But first ... President Biden is enjoying a big bounce in approval ratings after his second State of the Union.
In a CNN poll of speech viewers... 71% said Biden's policies would move the country in the right direction, compared to only 52% saying that "before" his speech.


The president's theme last night... get the job done. But what are the things he wants done first and foremost?
Joining us now to talk about the State of the Union... Santa Clara County Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren.
**what did you think of the president's speech? are you surprised by his favorability bounce?
**do you think he's running... did he shore up Democratic support with his performance?
**he went to toe to toe with members of the GOP... the most intense sparring came during the part on protecting social security and medicare. listen.


**did he just corner the GOP into committing to not cutting entitlements on national TV? was that intentional?
**what do you think your marching orders are... based on what he outlines as priorities? What do you need to deliver on?
**we only saw moments on tv, like when Marjorie Taylor Greene, shouted "liar" and booed the president. But you were there... what did you see, hear and feel in terms of partisan rancor? 
*one moment that stood out was when actually Republican versus Republican. Utah senator Mitt Romney told New York Congressman George Santos, who we know lied about major parts of his life story and is under a house ethics investigation that "he shouldn't be here." Today, Santos fired back and said Romney wasn't being "very mormon." Does this make you sad?
*one area that i think got some across the aisle support was when the president talked about big tech... not so much when he talked about taxing them at a higher rate than teacerhs... but when he talked about maybe reforming or regulating the industry. let's listen.


**you represent silicon valley... so your constituents include the companies, the people who work for them, and the people use the products... how do you intend to help all?
**You and East Bay congressman Eric Swalwell announced your State of the Union guests together... two noted women scientist working on fusion energy... is there a new collaboration between your offices?
Should sex work be legalized in San Francisco?
For some, it's a question of morality. 


For other's...  it's a concept that is way over due. 
And now at least one county supervisor is  making a push to create a red-light district in the city. 
Taking a new look at the world's oldest profession. 
Good afternoon

 "I just want to make sure that the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has everything it needs to test for every potential drug that's costing the lives of anyone in San Francisco." 
He says tracking the drugs causing accidental overdoses. . . will be key in combatting the crisis. 
 "I also want to make sure that OCME has the ability to test retroactively to see if something has already arrived that we weren't aware of."

The president also taking aim at social media platforms, pushing for bipartisan support against industry practices.
Mr. Biden says now is the time to finally hold social media companies accountable for what he calls a quote, "experiment they are running on our children for profit."
Silicon valley tech experts were not surprised by the president's tone during his address and his message to "big tech."

 
Biden mentioned banning targeted advertising towards children, and imposing stricter limits on personal data collection.

2023 was off to a much better start… but the numbers are up in the past two weeks ..  4 lives claimed ... two of them pedestrians.
People simply walking through their city… killed on the roadways.
One on Jackson Avenue near i-680… The second in South San Jose near Blossom Hill Road and Monterey Highway… that man was part of the unhoused community and lived in a nearby encampment.
The DOT says unhoused pedestrian deaths tripled from 2019 to 2021... and Shaunn Cartwright with the unhoused response group is trying to do what she can to save lives.
She has been going around to encampments like this one handing out headlamps to residents to help keep them safe while moving around at night.
The City's Department of Transportation has tried similar outreach programs in year's past .. 
an effort to address the intersection in which two of San Jose's biggest problems meet… traffic safety and homelessness. 
They've also handed out lights and informational cards and installed temporary signage to warn drivers of people walking in the area.

As part of Building a Better Bay Area, we sometimes focus on the soaring cost of healthcare. 
Tonight, an extreme example. 
A solano county couple went in for a rabies shot, and the bill from that single, simple visit to the hospital?
 More than 200-thousand dollars. 
They called the I-Team's Dan Noyes to investigate.
dan?
Tens of thousands of people each year receive a series of shots to prevent rabies after a possible exposure. It normally costs between $1,200 and $6,800. Not in this case!
The Aguilars wound up paying $35-hundred out of pocket. The insurance company told me today that they "are reaching out to NorthBay Healthcare … to address these excessive charges." . By the way, the rabies expert said, chances are that bat was not infected. The couple should have kept it, had it tested for rabies, and may have avoided the shots in the first place.
prosecutors have now filed charges against THE MAN WHO FIRED BLANK ROUNDS INside A SAN FRANCISCO SYNAGOGUE.
the synagogue's surveillance camera captured it all.
the charges are TWO FELONY COUNTS OF OBSTRUCTING EXERCISE OF RELIGION.
OFFICIALS FROM THE SYNAGOGUE HAD CALLED THIS AN ACT OF HATE.

The San Francisco Business Times hosted the event in Oakland at the Marriott yesterday.
Each mayor shared her vision for her city as well as the entire Bay Area.
Newly elected Oakland mayor Sheng Thao says she is eyeing revitalizing the downtown area by tapping into people who already call Oakland home.

 
Housing was another major topic touched on during the summit.
According to the Chronicle, the state has rejected Oakland's plan to build more than 26-thousand new housing units over the next eight years.
Every city in the state was required to submit a plan by January 31st... or risk fines and the threat of developers being allowed to build projects that don't meet local zoning restrictions.
The report says the state rejected the housing plans for majority of Bay Area cities, including Berkeley.


THE SHOCK FROM A HOUSE EXPLOSION IN SAN FRANCISCO COULD BE FELT 20 BLOCKS AWAY. 
IT'S GEARING UP TO BE ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY HERE IN THE BAY AREA...
LET'S CHECK IN WITH METEOROLOGIST DREW TUMA FOR A QUICK CHECK OF THE WARMING TEMPERATURES. 
Today, San Francisco Mayor London Breed will deliver her "State of the City" address.
It comes at a time when some residents in the Mission say the sex trafficking problem is the worst they have seen it.
In response, Supervisor Hillary Ronen is backing a plan to create a sanctioned red light district - which could legalize and regulate sex work.
Barricades are going up at 21st and Capp Streets.
It's part of a push to curb sex work on one street.

 
Mayor Breed's address is expected to start around noon.
We will stream it live on the ABC7 News app and on ABC7 News dot com.
We also expect the mayor to address the city's growing drug crisis.
We are following reports of a new synthetic opioid is showing up on city streets that's 20 times more powerful than fentanyl.
The drug is called  Isotonitazene "" ISO-   Tah-   Nite-  ah-  Zeen"" ... or "ISO" for short.
Dealers are reportedly slipping ISO into other illicit drugs.
Its apparently showing UP IN D-E-A labs, mixed with heroin and  fentanyl, or pressed into counterfeit prescription pills. 
San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey calls the revelation troubling and has sent an alert to the Medical Examiner's office.


Dorsey also wants to make sure that the medical examiner has the ability to test for the drug *retroactively, as well.
He says tracking the drugs causing accidental overdoses is the key in combating the crisis. 
ABC7 NEWS REPORTER TARA CAMPBELL has covered the drug overdose crisis extensively, And just put together an ABC 7 Originals Documentary titled "Injecting Hope".
She traveled to the safe injection site in  Vancouver, Canada to see how it works.

A California father who has been charged with attempted murder is expected to enter a plea today.
"Dharmesh Patel" is accused of driving off a 250-foot cliff with his wife and kids in the car.
All four family members survived and were rescued from the bottom of Devil's Slide off Highway 101 last month.
Patel's wife and 7-year-old suffered serious injuries.
The four-year-old only had minor injuries.
Family members found guilty of running a human trafficking ring out of a  Daly City daycare will spend at least 5 years in prison.
Joshua,  Carlina, and Noel  Gamos were just sentenced on trafficking and labor-related charges after being found guilty last June.
The California Attorney General said the crimes happened from 2008 to 2018 while the family ran "Rainbow Bright."
The family trafficked their employees by doing things like threatening arrest and deportation, making false promises to help with immigration, and confiscating passports.
They targeted members of the Filipino community, many of whom recently immigrated to the U-S.


A fourth family member --  Gerlen  Gamos-- previously  pled guilty and will be sentenced later. 
Voting rights could be reinstated to incarcerated people convicted of felonies.
A new bill proposed this week would amend the state constitution to let incarcerated people vote.
Two-thirds of each chamber of the state legislature must vote yes for the bill to appear on the ballot.
Then voters must approve it for it to become an amendment.
If passed, California would join Maine and Vermont as the only states where people convicted of felonies would keep their right to vote.
The Nation's Capitol -- Washington, D.C. also has a similar law on the books. 
It's masks back on for some students in Marin County after a recent spike in Covid-19 cases.
Four elementary schools have reinstated indoor mask mandates in some of their classrooms.
The Marin County Public Health Office has not given out the names of the schools because they want to honor their confidentiality agreement.
To put this in perspective.. as of last week there were 53 cases reported at all Marin elementary schools. 
While there are cases among middle and high school students, there are no reported clusters among the older students.
Officials say these outbreaks are to be expected. 

 
80-percent of kids, age five through 11, in Marin County are vaccinated against  COVID. 
Health officials say are not concerned about a potential spread since COVID wastewater levels continue to go down. 
In the meantime, of course they're reminding students to take the necessary steps to limit the spread.
More help is on the way for people impacted by the winter storms in San Mateo County.
a MOBILE REGISTRATION INTAKE CENTER IS NOW OPEN TO HELP PEOPLE PAY FOR FEMA DISASTER ASSISTANCE.
it will be in Pescadero today... La Honda tomorrow and Saturday...
and sunday and monday you can find it in half moon bay.
in addition to san mateo county, disaster assistance is also available in alameda, contra costa, and santa cruz counties.
A non-profit is giving the San Jose City Council a failing grade when it comes to policing. 
The report card is something new Mayor Matt  Mahan is calling unfair. 
Sacred Heart Community Service released it's annual report card this week. 
It grades elected officials on how they vote on a number of issues including policing, homelessness, and immigration. 
It gave all but one city council member who served under former mayor sam liccaro an 'f' grade for policing.
liccardo also received an 'f' .
The non-profit says the city needs to invest more into it's mental health response, versus sending officers to emergency calls. 

 
Sacred Heart stands by it's assessment, saying it shows policy makers the community's expectations.

Dan, Mayor Breed really laying it all out on the table today when discussing the list of problems that San Francisco is facing. 
And while she gave her plan to address these issues, other city leaders wasted no time in pushing back. 
Another big thing that Mayor Breed stressed was that downtown San Francisco as we knew it pre-pandemic is never coming back.
But, she says that's okay, and she encouraged people to look at this as an opportunity to create a new San Francisco, just as innovative as before.
In the newsroom, Tim Johns, ABC7 News.

New details on a horrific story out of Oakland.
The owner of a beloved bakery has died from injuries suffered during a robbery earlier this week. 
Jen Angel had been in a medically-induced coma since the robbery on Monday in the Downtown area. 
Angel was dragged while trying to stop thieves who'd broken into her car. 
Friends described Angel as a community activist but she also founded "Angel Cakes" bakery, which has a storefront in Jack London Square. 
The bakery provides cupcakes and other pastries to many in the Oakland community.


A go-fund-me has been set up to support her loved ones and help keep the bakery open. 
The shop has already seen an outpouring of support. 
So much so, organizers are asking customers to buy gift cards rather than cupcakes for now...because staff is overwhelmed. 
The cost for San Francisco's downtown rail extension project is now estimated at more than 6-point-6 Billion dollars.
That's the figure the Transbay Joint Powers Board received during today's presentation of the 20-year financial plan.
Vice Chair Rafael Mandelman says it's the closest they've been to having a realistic cost estimate for project.. which is set to open for service in 2032.

 
An oversight committee will review the estimates, and report back in six months.
Yahoo is the latest Bay Area tech company to announce major cuts to its workforce.
It's planning to let go of 20-percent of its workforce or about 16-hundred people in all.
Nearly a thousand employees are going to be let go this week.
The web giant plans to turn its "Yahoo for Business" division into "Yahoo Advertising"... and that's where about half of the cuts will be made. 
Eight people are now in custody in what authorities are calling a statewide organized retail theft operation targeting Apple Stores... including several in the Bay Area.
Here's a look at some of the products recovered during the arrests--thousands of dollars worth of iphones, as well i-pads and other electronics.
Attorney general Rob Bonta says the suspects stole a million dollars in goods between August of last year and last month.

 
Bonta credited the highway patrol and law enforcement agencies from around the state for assisting in the investigation and arrests.

An explosion rocks a San Francisco neighborhood.
So strong -- it was felt 20 blocks away!

The 51-year-old is facing felony charges and hate crime allegations.
Investigators say surveillance video shows him walking into the Schneerson Center on Balboa Street and firing a gun loaded with blanks.
We heard from his public defender today.

 
San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins says the hate crime allegations are tied to statements he made and social media posts.
He's expected to be back in court on February 17th after today's arraignment was postponed.
Obviously she seems optimistic, but there is also something called reality. Nobody is sugar coating this. It's going to be a hard 2023 and beyond for Mayor Breed. She's already asking departments to make deep budget cuts. The so-called "Golden Goose" for the city which was the tax revenue from downtown office spaces will probably never be what it once was and we're going to see that in the city's budget. And...gone are the federal funds. It seems that, at this point, Mayor Breed is adopting Harvey Milk's famous phrase, "You have to give them hope."  In the newsroom, Lyanne Melendez ABC7 news.

that's what she heard - this is what she saw -- it blew up a house, sent a firefighter to the hospital, and disrupted a neighborhood.
plus..


how can san francisco build a better bay area?
the mayor has a plan.
and.. the i-team follows up on sex trafficking outside an oakland school.
what's changed since our story first aired.
I compared last year's speech with the one today. I found that in 2022 Mayor Breed's main focus was on the impact COVID had, for two years, on San Francisco.  Today's speech was more like a survivor getting past a shipwreck, without the distraction of COVID and having a better picture of what it will take to get San Francisco back on course.
Obviously the mayor seems optimistic, but there is also something called reality. It's going to be a hard 2023 and beyond for Mayor Breed. She's already asking departments to make deep budget cuts. The so-called "Golden Goose" for the city which was the tax revenue from downtown office spaces will probably never be what it once was and we're going to see that in the city's budget. And...gone are the federal funds. It seems that, at this point, Mayor Breed is adopting Harvey Milk's famous phrase, "You have to give them hope."  
LYANNE, stay with us while we bring abc7 news insider phil matier into this conversation.
phil -- your initial thoughts -- will we see San Francisco get better with Mayor Breed's plans?






phil and lyanne, i'd like you both to weigh in on the challenge of public safety.
lyanne, you shot this video of a blatent theft at a walgreens in hayes valley back in june of 2021.
that got a lot of attention - even mayor breed reacted to it.
how can we improve public safety issues like this?








mayor breed addressed the media directly in her speech today. 
Let's listen to what she said.


phil.. your reaction to that?




THANKS PHIL AND LYANNE

If someone asks you to pay with a giftcard, think twice.
Scammers are now trying to trick Comcast customers into purchasing Target giftcards for them.
Here's what happened to Amy Gac  ""gak"" from Palo Alto. 
She got a call offering 50 percent off her Comcast bill, if she signed up for another two years of service.
The catch?
She had to pay for the next full year of service upfront.
The scammer told her to buy giftcards from Target because Comcast and Target made a deal for this promotion....
And he told her if she did it within 100 minutes, they would throw in a 100-dollar Visa Gift Card. 
She bought the Target cards and submitted the gift card numbers and access codes to the scammer.


Target declined to cover the losses in this case.
The FTC says scammers instruct people to purchase gift cards of any kind from Target, more than any other retailer.
 In an email -- a Target spokesperson said...
"We take these crimes very seriously. We have signs in our stores and share general safety tips with our team members so they can stay alert and help guests as best as they can."

Good evening and thanks for joining us,

ABC7 NEWS METEOROLOGIST sandhya patel IS TRACKING THIS FOR US.
SANDHYA, WHEN DOES THE RAIN ARRIVE?
When you consider that office spaces bring in so much direct and indirect revenue to the city and to small businesses, it's important to know that the vacancies represent a serious financial problem for San Francisco. We took a closer look at what the city plans to do.   
Why have other cities like New York, Boston for example recovered quicker than San Francisco?
Well, we can spend hours comparing those cities to San Francisco but I looked at one report that said that 18 percent of the workforce in New York City is comprised of jobs like accounting, lawyers, advertising, consulting, computer systems.  San Francisco--31 percent  of downtown workers in San Francisco are in that sector. And guess what?  Most, if not all, of those jobs can be performed at home. That's why the city now says, we have to mix it up. 
turning now to our work to build a better bay area.
San Francisco.. especially its downtown.. serves as the economic hub of the Bay Area.
but Today... Downtown is mostly deserted as workers and companies adopt more flexible work from home schedules.  
ABC7 news reporter Lyanne Melendez joins us live to take a look at the "Roadmap to Downtown San Francisco's future."

San Jose Police are searching for two drivers .. after a deadly hit-and-run.
investigators say a woman was crossing Morrill Avenue by valhalla drive just before dawn this morning.
she was not in the crosswalk. 
they say she was hit by a dark colored sedan which then kept going.
shortly after that .. she was run over again by what appears to be a U-Haul van.
The victim was taken to a local hospital - she did not survive.
This is San Jose's fifth traffic death this year.
NOW TO DEVELOPING NEWS -- YESTERDAY'S DEADLY HOUSE EXPLOSION IN SAN FRANCISCO LED TO A HAZMAT SITUATION TODAY IN DALY CITY... THAT DISRUPTED BART SERVICE FOR HOURS.

abc7 news reporter ryan curry was there.
Good morning

We also have segments like 77 seconds of fun and.... Jobina is making a couple cameos in today's show...
We're also doing things like dREW'S emoji forecast...

 
Time now for the lead...
It's an explosion at a San Francisco home, that killed one person.
Crews at still at the home on 22nd Avenue in the Sunset District --  more than 21-hours after the blast.
It was so powerful, it knocked the home off its foundation... and it eventually collapsed.
ABC7 reporter Lena Howland just spoke with fire investigators ... lena what is the update?
Good morning, Lena.
Time now for first focus - where we pick a couple stories and take a closer look at them....
Today we're talking about part of san francisco mayor london breed's state of the city address..
And a costly caltrain project...
We begin with the mayor...
Her proposal involves tax breaks to bring more companies downtown...
aCCORDING TO THE CHRONICLE, THE tax BREAKS would go to businesses in certain industries - a max of one million dollars in incentives would be given to new offices...
That incentive doesn't only apply to downtown but obviously that's a big target. 
it needs approval from the board of supervisors - but some say they don't want to see massive handouts to corporations when progressive taxes on the rich are keeping the city "afloat"...
Our other focus....
caltrain my finally be reaching the salesforce tower... but the price tag is raising some eyebrows...
The final 1-point-3 mile is expected to cost six-pooint-7 billion dollars...
That's obviously causing pause for planners on the project...
The completion date... 2032....
Before we get ready for our news update on-air... take a look at what's coming up on abc at 7...
We have 77 seconds of fun stories that will probably lead to us talking about rihanna...

A sad development in Oakland this morning - The owner of a bakery has died from injuries suffered during a robbery earlier this week. 
Jen Angel had been in a medically-induced coma since the robbery on Monday in the Downtown area. 
Angel was dragged while trying to stop thieves who'd broken into her car. 
Friends described Angel as a community activist but she also founded "Angel Cakes" bakery, which has a storefront in Jack London Square. 
The bakery provides cupcakes and other pastries to many in the Oakland community.


A go-fund-me has been set up to support her loved ones and help keep the bakery open. 
The shop has already seen an outpouring of support. 
So much so, organizers are asking customers to buy gift cards rather than cupcakes for now...because staff is overwhelmed. 
Authorities say they've busted a statewide organized retail theft operation targeting Apple stores, including some in the Bay Area.
Eight people are in custody this morning.
Here's a look at some of the products recovered during the arrests.
Thousands of dollars worth of iphones, as well i-pads and other electronics.
Attorney general Rob Bonta says the suspects stole a million dollars in goods between August of last year and last month.

 
Bonta credited the highway patrol and law enforcement agencies from around the state for assisting in the investigation and arrests.

City officials sharing these earlier photos-- saying they're unclear of the exact metal the statue was made of...
Adding it may be bronze coated.
But a breakthrough early Thursday by our media partners at the Mercury News.
Joseph Hedges, the city's International Relations Manager, says there is certainly plenty of work ahead to determine what repairs are needed--
Whether it could be reinstalled and what security measures should be considered.

ABC7 news is committed to Building a Better Bay Area and one of the issues we're focusing on is homelessness.
Last night a group of unhoused people put on a play in an effort to humanize people who struggle with the issue. 
The play comes amid a court battle over the city of Oakland's effort to clean up the Wood Street camp.
ABC7 News Reporter Tara Campbell tells us, the timely and unique performance offers its own solutions. 
 "Wait a minute that's my stuff . . .  
A glimpse at "Crushing Wheelchairs" . . . a play presented by Theatre of the Poor . . . its entire cast made up the unhoused . . . or once unhoused. 
 "It humanizes ourselves that we are not just drug addicts, houseless people, there's actually families and children, aunties and uncles, and grandmas." 
Miguel Muteaeo ""Moo-teeaaaoh"" . . . joined by a handful of fellow cast members . . . and playwright . . . poet and activist . . . Lisa Gray-Garcia, known best as "Tiny."
 "The main reason we did this play and the work we always do is to lift up poor people's solutions."  
The play portrays the struggles of life on the streets and triumphs of community. 
Premiering in San Francisco Sunday afternoon 
 "This is not a play done by middle-class actors playing for people  this actually ourselves being impacted who have lived through poverty and struggle."
The City of Oakland in its own struggle . . . this week the State rejecting its affordable housing proposal . . . putting much needed funding in jeopardy. 
Councilmember Noel Gallo says the decision was surprising . . . 
 "The reality is Oakland does not have all the money necessary to do all the work as quickly as we'd like to do it."
And the pressure is on . . .  
Friday a federal judge halting the removal of the Wood Street encampment. 
The city was supposed to start relocating residents to three other sites, including a cabin community.
 But the judge reversed course, because the sites are not ready.
 "We have several sites in East Oakland. We're trying to develop RV locations that will house a hundred-plus RV's, but it takes time."
In the meantime . . . this cast says . . . the show must go on . . . 
 "We're more than just numbers and trash because they are always trying to sweep us.  We are humanbeings we are a community."

Jimmy!
In the East Bay ... Oakland is still dealing with a ransomware attack that has taken some city systems offline.
Experts say it's likely that a phishing email led to data being compromised.
Hackers typically demand a Bitcoin ransom to be deposited in an overseas account to de-crypt the files.
So now, Oakland can either pay the ransom, or spend possibly millions to recover the data on its own.

 
Oakland issued a statement Friday, saying 9-1-1 and emergency services were not affected.
But when I tried to get a copy of a police report over the weekend...was told the files were unavailable because of the attack.
The city of Oakland did not respond to our request for an update today.
Tomorrow-- San Francisco Supervisor Hillary Ronan will introduce a plan to sanction a red light district and legalize sex work.
 In the meantime--the "San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency" set up barricades to curb prostitution along some Mission District streets. 
Temporary barriers were installed on Capp Street between 18th and 22nd streets last Friday.
Residents say the city's attempt to deter prostitution is becoming a hazard.
Drivers are seen running over barriers... and alleged sex workers are spilling over to nearby streets.


SFMTA replaced several broken barricades Monday morning.
Residents tell us - the alleged sex workers are not San Francisco residents... and are believed to be from Oakland.

And nearly 38 teens and children under 18 are experiencing homelessness. 
ABC7 News has documented years of advocacy by S-J-S-U students like Lana Gomez.
Gomez also works directly with homeless youth and families at the Bill Wilson Center in San Jose.
Reasons State Senator Dave Cortese is reintroducing a bill to provide monthly payments of one-thousand dollars to high school seniors in dire need.

In the South Bay ... A team of community and elected leaders was tasked by San Jose's new Mayor Matt Mahan to focus on how to define success in solving the city's biggest issues.
It's the first step in the Mayor's budget recommendations.
As ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains... the focus is on five key issues.
A team of community and elected leaders was  tasked by San Jose's new Mayor Matt Mahan to focus on how to define success in solving the city's biggest issues... and come up with solutions to do just that.
It's the first step in the Mayor's budget recommendations.
And as ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains... focusing individually on five key issues can help solve all the problems together.
How do you solve San Jose's biggest issues?
For new Mayor Matt Mahan... it starts with a committee led by city councilmembers and community leaders to help shape the budget.
The goal was simple... the city needs to get back to basics.
And community safety ideas were of high importance.
Hiring more officers is just part of the recommendations... but properly differentiating 911 calls from non-emergency calls and utilizing mental health and community service officers can also solve the city's biggest problem.
Public safety intersects with homelessness... another key pillar.
Finding more cost effective and faster way to get people housed is key.
And with only 317 emergency interim housing units created... well short of a past 1,000 unit goal... Mayor Mahan says the city has to live up to past promises.
And two of the committee co-chairs said today the best way to achieve all these goals is through their teamwork.
With these ideas in mind... the first budget message will be released next month.
In San Jose Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.
San Francisco's requirement to build more affordable housing is getting a little help from Sacramento.  
Today, legislation was introduced to further streamline and accelerate housing permits. 
ABC 7 news reporter  Lyanne Melendez is in the newsroom with the details.  
Lyanne, it'll still be hard for San Francisco to meet its goal. 
Even affordable housing experts have their doubts. You have to come up with the funding to see the project through, but before that there's the approval process, and the permitting process.  What cities and the state are trying to do is to fast track the process to build more units.  
Elaine Luna told her story of being unhoused then living in a shelter, 
unable to afford housing in San Francisco, 
 when the offer to live at this 144-unit building on Bryant Street came up.
The building she now lives in went through what is called a "streamlining approval process" under a a bill authored  by State Senator Scott Wiener in 2017, which means that instead of waiting on average two years for the plans to be approved, it took only four months. 
Overall, the building was up and operational 30 percent faster that average.
In the past, anyone could hire an attorney to attempt to stop the construction of an affordable housing building, for any reason. 
Not anymore and today, Wiener introduced legislation to expand that bill indefinitely-giving cities like San Francisco a better chance to meet their goals. 
San Francisco is on the hook to build 82-thousand units in the next eight years. 
Roughly half of those have had their plans approved. 
From that moment on, there's still a ways to go before people move in. 
Best case scenario is five years. 
Even if you build those already approved, San Francisco only gets half way to its goal of building 82-thousand units. That's why Mayor London Breed recently talked about getting creative. For example, make it easier to convert offices into housing. Lift zoning restrictions is another proposal. And the mayor made it very clear, every neighborhood, whether they like it or not, will have to be part of the city's housing future. In the newsroom, Lyanne Melendez ABC7 News. 
Warriors Fan favorite Gary Payton the second will be on the bench with his old teammates tonight, but not in uniform.
The Dubs reacquired Payton from the Portland Trailblazers last Thursday in a four team trade.
But the deal hit a snag, when Payton failed his physical exam due to a core muscle injury.
Today General manager Bob Myers explained why they went ahead with the trade, even though Payton will be sidelined indefinitely. 

 
Myers says Payton's injury will be re-evaluated in a month, and they hope to have him back for the playoffs.

The new information about what's going on... and the growing concerns for national security.
Good morning.
It's MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist Drew Tuma.


We're getting a new look at the explosion that rocked San Francisco's Sunset District earlier this week. 
Neighbors tell us they were outside that home on 22nd avenue, and were hit with debris.
ABC7 reporter Lena Howland joins us now live from San Francisco, where a pile of debris now sits where that home was.
Lena.
That's right.
There was the spy balloon from China last week -- and now three unidentified objects over the weekend.
The most recent was shot down yesterday over Lake Huron.
Senior administration officials say the octagon shaped structure was unmanned, traveling at about 20 thousand feet near sensitive sites.
So far there's no indication of surveillance capabilities for any of the objects seen over the weekend.
While there are a lot of questions about why so many objects have been detected recently -- the Pentagon tells ABC News after the spy balloon from China was discovered, NORAD turned up the sensitivity of its radars to detect smaller objects.


This latest incident comes just one day after U.S. Fighter jet shot down an unidentified, unmanned object over Canada's Yukon territory on Saturday.
Just a day before that, another unidentified object was shot down off the coast of Alaska. 
US officials are looking for the wreckage from the object shot down in the Yukon. But so far the ice and weather conditions are hampering their efforts.

There are growing national security concerns this morning -- after a series of unidentified flying objects were discovered in U-S airspace over the weekend.

Jacqui Berlinn holds a photo of her son Corey . . . he's battling addiction on the streets of the Tenderloin . . . and she's worried about Tranq.
 "He said whatever was in the drugs that he took made it so he just absolutely could not move his body." 
Xylazine . . . also known as Tranq . . .  is used by veterinarians to sedate large animals . . . and when mixed with already-powerful opioids . . . it's deadly. 
 "I believe Tranq is already on the street, unfortunately."  
It's been most pervasive in the Northeast . . . but the DEA warns Tranq is showing up more and more out west. 
Over a two year period the DEA's lab reports a more than 100 percent increase of xylazine in the illicit drug supply . . .  being snuck into deadly opioids like Fentanyl. 
 "I just want to make sure that our city is set up to be monitoring for this and testing for it."  
San Francisco Supervisor Matt Dorsey . . . writing this letter to the medical examiner . . . in support of its efforts to start testing overdose victims for xylazine this year. 
 "The work they are doing given the crisis we're facing is life-saving and we have to fight for this." 
And because it's not an opioid — an overdose caused by xylazine  cannot be reversed by Narcan — the nasal spray relied on so heavily . . . in saving lives. 
 "Narcan is deployed thousands of times a year citywide among the interventions that we count from first responders."
Making the tracking of Tranq that much more critical . . . says the supervisor.
 "God forbid if there's an addictive drug out there for which these interventions aren't going to work it's going to be terrifying."
As for Jacqui she's all for the medical examiner's move to test for Tranq . . . and if it's detected . . . she has a suggestion. 
 "Maybe put out public notices in some way to those on the streets so they know the supply is tainted with Tranq and protect themselves."
ABC7 NEWS REPORTER TARA CAMPBELL has covered the drug overdose crisis extensively... And just put together an ABC 7 Originals Documentary titled "Injecting Hope".
she traveled to NORTH AMERICA'S FIRST EVER safe injection site in vancouver, canada to see how it works.

The city of Oakland is still dealing with a ransomware attack that has taken some city systems offline... although 911 and fire services are still up and running. 
ABC7 news reporter Leslie Brinkley dug into the decisions the city is facing ... and the fallout
How was the city of Oakland hacked? Experts say it was most likely a phishing email that led to compromising their data. 
 The FBI via a government website defines ransomware as "an ever-evolving form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable." The hackers usually make a demand for a bitcoin ransom to be deposited in an overseas account to de-crypt the files.  It can cost thousands, if not millions for a company or a city to back up its systems instead of paying the ransom. 
Oakland issued a statement Friday that  911 and emergency services were not affected by the ransomware. But when ABC7 news attempted to get a copy of a police report over the weekend, the response was that the files were unavailable due to the attack. The city of Oakland has not responded to a request for an interview or update today.

A town hall is just getting underway in San Francisco to talk about a proposal to provide reparations for some Black residents in the city.
It's happening at Third Baptist Church in the Fillmore District -- on McAllister Street.
It started at eleven.
Some civil rights leaders are calling for long-overdue solutions to address systemic racism.
That includes a one-time, five-million dollar payment to eligible Black residents.
To qualify, people would need to be 18 or older, identify as Black or African American on public documents for at least 10 years, and meet two of eight additional criteria.

 
But not everyone agrees with this plan.
The chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party opposes the proposal by the city's reparations committee -- saying San Francisco can not afford to do it.
The plan will be presented to the Board of Supervisors next month.
Happening today.
Supervisor Hillary  Ronen is expected to introduce a plan to sanction a red light district and legalize sex work in San Francisco.
This proposal comes after S-F-M-T-A set up barricades to curb prostitution along some Mission District streets.

The mayor's office says if  supervisors do not approve the funding, the city would  be required to impose a hiring and overtime freeze.
Between 2021 and 2022, the  Police Department saw a 121-percent increase in total overtime.
 While authorities are saying little about the suspect, Anthony McRae, -- law enforcement sources revealed this morning that officers found a two-page note in his backpack referencing other shootings.
The note reportedly made threats to two schools in Ewing, New Jersey, near Trenton, where he grew up.
Officials there canceled classes there today as OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.

San Francisco Supervisor Hillary Ronen has introduced a controversial measure to regular sex work in the city.
Last night, the board considered Ronen's resolution urging state lawmakers from San Francisco to introduce legislation to legalize sex work and allow cities to setup red light districts.
Ronen admits this isn't something that will happen overnight.


Ronen is introducing this resolution in response to the city setting up barricades to curb sex work along Capp street in the Mission District.
It's an issue ABC7 News first spotlighted earlier this month.
Happening today.
Help for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the Bay area.
San Francisco city leaders will hold a summit - to inform people about resources available if they are the victim of a crime.
They'll also discuss the police department's Community Liaison Unit, which aims to build trust between officers and communities of color.

Some local lawmakers are working to ensure everyone continues to have the right to get and stay married in California.
State Senator Scott Wiener and California Assembly member Evan Low just introduced a constitutional amendment to repeal prop 8, which banned same sex marriage in the state.  
It's been 15 years since Californians passed it with more than 52 percent of the vote.
The law was later overturned in court and when the U-S Supreme Court ruled that bans against same sex marriages were unconstitutional, prop 8 was essentially struck down...
But it hasn't disappeared entirely.


The amendment to repeal prop 8 would have to pass with two thirds of the legislature.
If it does, then it will be on the November 2024 ballot for California voters to decide.
The San Francisco Police Department says they do have an open and active investigation into this incident.
They encourage anyone with any information to reach out to them directly.
It's an attack that came out of nowhere.

 A firestorm among top leaders in Oakland tonight.
The police chief -- canned by the newly-elected mayor.
and tonight -- it seems everyone has an opinion on the firing of "Leronne Armstrong".
Good Evening, I'm Ama Daetz.
and I'm Dan Ashley.
Oakland Mayor "Sheng Thao" made headlines today by terminating Chief Armstrong after first having placed him on administrative leave.
The question of what comes next for Oakland residents -- looms large tonight.
 ABC7 News Reporter  J.R. Stone was at the mayor's announcement today and J-R -- the reaction has not stopped there.
Let's bring our focus outside now -- as you look live from our Sutro Tower camera -- because a second straight night of freezing temperatures is moving in.
And most all of the Bay Area will be feeling it starting tomorrow.
Sandhya Patel is here with just what all we should expect?

And for more complete coverage...
ABC7 News sent a push alert -- just like this one -- as that first word broke about Chief Armstrong's firing.

And it seems that no one is shy about LeRonne Armstrong, who was well liked by many in Oakland. 
But in the Mayor's biggest move since taking office, "Sheng Thao" looked past that, making that key decision to cut ties with the chief.
Keep in mind - this position atop the Oakland police department has been a rocky one, to say the least.
Dating back from Armstrong there have been *ten people to hold the job in some capacity since 2009.
One key name... was Anne Kirkpatrick.
She started in 2017 as oakland's first female police chief but was then fired in 2020 for reporting alleged misconduct.
kirkpatrick actually sued over her termination and won.
Before her... Sean Whent ""went"".
HE RESIGNED in 2016 AFTER MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT ADMITTED TO HAVING SEX WITH AN UNDERAGED PROSTITUTE WHO WENT BY THE NAME CELESTE GUAP.
following his resignation.. oakland went through three chiefs in nine days!
As if the city of Oakland doesn't have enough problems... a recent ransomware attack continues to cripple key city services. 
People needing to get some errands done today came by city hall to see signs saying the building was closed.
"KATHY PARK" WAS ONE OF THEM.
SHE HAD TO PAY HER BUSINESS LICENSE FEE THAT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH.
IF SHE DOESN'T PAY BY THEN SHE WILL GET A LATE FEE.




The city of  oakland didn't respond to our request for comment.
Oakland issued a local state of emergency yesterday because of outages caused by  ransomware.
City officials say the attack first happened a week ago. 
An attempt at humor goes horribly wrong for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.

New developments in the deadly neighborhood blast that rocked part of San Francisco's Outer Sunset district last week.
The suspect -- appearing in court today for the first time...

Tonight -- ABC7 News reporter Tim Johns joins us live in the studio with more details on this.

Another mass shooting tonight.
One person is dead and three others are injured when shots were fired at the food court of a mall in El Paso, Texas.
Police say two suspects are under arrest, but the motive is not clear.
Tonight's shooting prompted an immediate response by law enforcement.
The mall is near a Walmart where 23 people were killed in a hate-fueled mass shooting in 2019.
That gunman pleaded guilty to federal charges last week.




Dan, the wreckage of the blast on the entire block is still difficult to overstate.
Even though this meeting was closed to the media and non-locals...
We were able to catch up with some in attendance.
And for many, it's clear the events of the past few days have left a lasting impact. 
""STOP FOR SOT""

A candlelight vigil held tonight for the victims of Monday's mass shooting on the campus of Michigan State.
The school's basketball head coach "Tom Izzo" and Governor of Michigan joined tonight's healing.

Earlier in the day, other Michigan State students protested nearby at the state capitol in Lansing.
A 43-year-old gunman open fire on the Michigan State campus Monday... killing three students and injuring five others.
The shooter died from a self-inflicted gun wound.
Shortly after the firing, Armstrong released this strong statement saying, quote...
"I am deeply disappointed in the Mayor's decision. 
After the relevant facts are fully evaluated by weighing evidence instead of pulling soundbites from strategically leaked, inaccurate reports, it will be clear I was a loyal and effective reformer ... 
of the Oakland Police Department. 
It will be equally clear that I committed no misconduct, and my termination is fundamentally wrong, unjustified, and unfair.
 Armstrong has not yet decided if he will take legal action.

**have you talked to her today, yesterday or very recently about this decision? how does she feel about it?
**you broke a lot of ground and glass ceilings together, didn't you? she won her office in 1990... you came in two years later... how unheard of and improbable was it at that time, for two women to be elected as senators?
**you didn't seek reelection in 2016 and retired in 2017. Your whole senate career was with Feinstein... you have more insight than anyone into how she works, and what she wants for California... share some of that insight with us... what do we not know or truly understand?
**you've talked about how she's helped you so much in your career... in what ways?
**you retired when you were around 75... Senator feinstein's going to be 90 when she retires... could you have stayed in office for as long as she has?
**your tweet congratulating her makes it clear that her biggest legacy was getting the the assault weapons ban passed in 1994. Why was that issue drive her so much? How improbable was it that she got that done?
**It's been expired now for almost 20 years now... is it possible to pass it now?
**the race to replace her... breaking news, barbara lee just announced, after respresentatives Adam Schiff and Katie Porter have announced. Who might you endorse?

Now to an Iteam investigation about an elevator that hasn't worked for weeks.
It's in a supportive housing building for the elderly and people with disabilities. 
ABC7 News I-Team reporter Melanie Woodrow a look at what's being done to address the problem.
A San Francisco supportive housing building for elderly residents and residents with disabilities has been without a working elevator for three and a half weeks. ABC7 News I-Team reporter Melanie Woodrow has more now on what went wrong and what's being done to address the problem)).
HomeRise provides affordable housing to approximately 120 elderly residents and residents with disabilities at 666 Ellis Street.
Last month, the building had a fire setting off sprinklers.
"The elevators were on the first floor and it was raining, it was pouring down raining in the elevators for hours."
Destroying electrical circuits and wiring .. and making the elevators inoperable.
"A lot of people called the city hall, 311, everywhere"
For three and a half weeks residents say they've struggled to navigate 13 flights of stairs.
"I had to go downstairs it didn't bother me but when I had to go upstairs it really hurt."
"We had one resident who slept downstairs this weekend because he couldn't get back upstairs."
"We have people that are stuck and can't get out to get groceries and can't get them delivered."
"It's been horrible and we've heard nothing from the management."
The interim CEO for HomeRise tells ABC7 News they've added additional staff to assist residents and have also ordered and delivered food and supplies.
Writing in an emailed statement, "Residents continue to be offered the option of being relocated during this time until the elevators are fixed."
HomeRise says contractors were on site the morning of the fire and have been waiting for parts to arrive.
"But it just seems in a building like this .. this a community that really needs reliable elevator service."
"It's a huge problem when an elevator is out in a building like this."
San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston says the Department of Building Inspection issued a notice requiring the elevators to be fixed.
He also says during the budget process last year the Senior and Disability Action Group said setting aside dedicated funds for elevator repairs was one of their top priorities in the budget.
"So that tells you that this is not an isolated situation in one building."
The issue residents say has happened before.
"The problem is that we went through this in September no elevators and waiting on parts for weeks."
"One elevator went down in December, waiting on parts, so what happens the next time the elevators go down?"
HomeRise's Interim CEO told ABC7 News he didn't have the history of any elevator problems readily available but that he checked with a staff member who said she didn't recall any in the last couple of years. He also shared the elevators have not been inspected by the state since 2018. The ABC7 News I-Team previously uncovered the backlog of state elevator inspections.
"Bottom line, we are here now waiting for the part."
Leaving a vulnerable population of residents feeling stuck.

Today we're talking about a push to require students to get the HPV vaccine...
And an update on that united airlines flight heading to san francisco... that took a nosedive...
We begin with the vaccine...
Assembly member Cecilia Aguiar-Curry ""ag-ee-ar curry"" just introduced a bill that would require all incoming 8th graders to get the shot.
The HPV vaccine has been on the market since 2006 when the FDA approved it as a way to prevent cervical cancer in women. 
But it also benefits men in the prevention of penile cancer. 
The recommendation is to have children vaccinated against HPV between the ages of 8 and 12. 


Students who are home-schooled or have a medical condition would be exempt.
Hearings on the bill will begin next month.
Our other focus..
We're learning more about that 14-hundred foot drop that terrified passengers on a United flight in December.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey spoke with an aviation expert about what happened.
The city of Oakland is now declaring a local state of emergency over a recent  ransomware attack.
The declaration allows the city to speed up what it needs to bring all city services back online.
Experts say the hack was most likely from a phishing email that compromised Oakland's data. 
The police department says its response times are slower as a result, but o-p-d claims its ability to respond to emergency calls is *not impacted.
Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao has announced new initiatives as part of her campaign promise to make public safety a top priority.
Her plan involves collaboration between police and business leaders.
Acting police chief Darren Allison says the department will reintroduce foot patrols.
Starting next week, the patrols will operate Monday through Friday during business hours in shopping areas.
Business owners also want to improve communication.

 
Chief Allison says this comes after the success of the department's holiday crime plan - which came out of the spike in crime last summer.
Police say homicides, shootings, and robberies were down in the last three months of 2022.
((A more than 14-hundred foot drop left airplane passengers gripping their seats and screaming for help in December... but thankfully everyone was okay.
We are learning new details about the United Airlines flight that nearly plunged toward the water after leaving Hawaii on its way to San Francisco.
ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey spoke with an aviation expert to try and learn a bit more as to why this happened.))
Just about as fast as it went up... it went down.
Passengers aboard a United Airlines Flight from Hawaii to San Francisco in December... remember the terrifying moments when their plane nearly nose dived into the Pacific Ocean.
According to Flight Tracking Data... the aircraft took off and reached 2,200 feet before going right back down.
For 21 seat-gripping seconds... a 1,425 foot drop... to only 775 feet above water.... before leveling out and ascending.
The NTSB announced Tuesday it is opening an investigation into the United Airlines 777 incident... and a preliminary report is expected in 2-3 weeks.
The FAA and United have not publically said why this happened... nearly 2 months later.
Until that time... ABC News Aviation Consultant and veteran Pilot John Nance has some theories.
While passengers said weather was bad... he does not think that is to blame.
The pilots involved were veterans and had more than 25,000 hours of flight time combined... and United said they received additional training after the incident.
That leads Nance to believe there may have been a glitch with the auto-flight system.
Nance says this isn't about blame... it's about understanding.
For Passenger Rod Williams... whatever the cause or reason... he says he's grateful for the amazing recovery efforts of the pilots.
It was the first flight for his two children, traveling with him and his wife after a Hawaiian vacation... and he's just thankful it wasn't their last.

We're also doing things like dREW'S emoji forecast...

 
Time now for the lead...
The state of Silicon Valley has been a big discussion recently, with major layoffs in the tech sector and the concerns about the overall economy... BUT Experts say the demise is overblown...
ABC7 News reporter Lena Howland is live in Mountain View with what we're expecting today...
Time now for first focus - where we pick a couple stories and take a closer look at them....
It's about technology and concerns over that technology.... we're looking at tiktok and chatbots...
Let's start with the old school... tik tok....
That growing concern surrounds your personal information and what the Chinese government is able to access.
Of course there are heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing -- following the discovery of that spy balloon flying over the U-S.
ABC7 News Reporter Gloria Rodriguez is in the newsroom this morning -- with the new call to ban the app across the country.
We want to add that TikTok did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.
The company previously said that it stores the data of U.S. users outside of China, and has never removed U.S. posts from the platform at the request of the Chinese government.


Congress and more than half of U.S. states have already banned TikTok from government devices. 
New legislation looks to ban the app from being downloaded on any US device. 
Now, the US Deputy Attorney General saying she would not advise using the social media app.
Lisa Monaco making this comment during a speech in London on Thursday, where she announced a new US technology "strike force." It's aimed at protecting American technology.. from national security threats.
The strike force is a joint effort from the commerce and justice departments.
TikTok is owned by one of China's most valuable private companies.. and if requested, TikTok would be required to turn over its data to the Chinese government due to China's national security laws.

 
U-S investigators are worried about the amount of personal information the app collects from its users...
The FBI director has also said he was concerned China could use the app to influence users or control their devices. 
in the past, tiktok has said it does not ... and would not... share personal information with the chinese government.
but Monaco says if a company is operating in China and collecting your data.. it's a good bet the Chinese government is accessing it.
The art gallery owner seen spraying a homeless person with a hose in San Francisco is expected to be arraigned today.
In this video that gained nationwide attention, you can see "Collier Gwin" spraying an unhoused person with a hose after he says he repeatedly asked for them to move.
Police arrested Gwin last month after D-A Brooke Jenkins issued a misdemeanor battery arrest warrant.
ABC7 News spoke with Gwin after the incident and eventually apologized for his actions.
He's set to appear in court at 9 this morning.

Frustration in Oakland ... and the calls to reinstate ousted police chief Leronne Armstrong.
and a devastating fire at the East Bay's oldest Black church..
Good afternoon
I'm Larry  Beil...
And I'm Kristen  Sze...
We'll have more on those stories in just a few minutes...
but first...
It's been less than a week since Former Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong was fired. 
Since then, calls to reinstate him are getting louder. 
Today, a rally was organized by the Oakland N-A-A-C-P, ABC7 News Reporter Cornell Barnard was there, and has new reaction from the former chief.
A one-two power punch for the east bay.... hit by two substantial PG&E outages in less than 24-hours.
Nearly 60-thousand customers had their power out from a substation fire ... and then another outage knocked out more power this morning.
As of a few minutes ago - power has been restored to the majority of people.
This week... Oakland Police officers will resume "foot patrols"... following a two-year hiatus.
Officers will be walking throughout business and shopping districts around the city.
Acting Chief Darren Allison and mayor Sheng Thao announced the resumption last Tuesday -- in an effort to address safety concerns expressed by business owners and to attract more shoppers.
 Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the fire at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Oakland.
It broke out around 11 last night, inside the church on Telegraph Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard.
ABC-7 News reporter Lena Howland has the details.
The previous teacher contract in Oakland expired in July 2017. It was only after teachers went on strike two years later that an agreement was finally reached, giving educators a 11 percent raise.
Now, Oakland finds itself in a similar situation as a new contract has not been reached. This time, teachers are demanding more money--nearly 23 percent, they say, in order to stay competitive with other surrounding districts and keep Oakland teachers from leaving the district. 
The teachers union says the school district was expected to make an offer on Thursday but has now delayed it until March 1. 
That may be because March 1 is when the district has to come up with a plan to close its anticipated budget deficit. Trade offs are expected.
Oakland's finances are of concern to the Alameda County Office of Education which recently downgraded the district's financial rating because of the school board's decision to rescind the planned closure of five schools. 
Thousands of residents in the city of Alameda lost power and so did two of the bridges that got stuck in an up position, blocking traffic. 
That's a concern... when you live on an island.
ABC7 news reporter Leslie Brinkley talked to the mayor about her concerns.
Lyanne has been reporting on bay area school issues for *decades - it's why she's our senior education reporter.
If you have a story idea - you can get in touch with Lyanne on twitter, facebook, or instagram.
 A suspect is now in custody in connection to the shooting death of a long-serving Los Angeles area Catholic bishop.
deputies found the body of Auxiliary Bishop David O'Connell inside his Hacienda Heights home on Saturday afternoon after receiving an emergency medical call.
He had been shot once in the chest.
This morning, authorities arrested 65-year old Carlos Medina following a tip they had received last night.


According to Sheriff Luna, Medina's wife was the Bishop's housekeeper, and he had DONE work at the bishop's home.
the 69-year old O'Connell was a beloved figure in the Los Angeles diocese, known for his work with the poor and BEING A "peacemaker" with between LOCAL STREET gangs.
For the past four months teachers in Oakland have been working without a contract. 
Negotiations are ongoing but the school district is warning that with the expected budget deficit, it's unlikely teachers will get what they want.  
ABC7 news senior education reporter   Lyanne Melendez has more on what's a stake
Next Monday, Sam Davis, the school board member for District 1 will be hosting a zoom town hall.  At that meeting, the Chief Financial Officer for the school district will explain the budget and let parents know what OUSD can and cannot afford if they want to balance that budget. In the newsroom, Lyanne Melendez ABC7 news. 
Teachers in Oakland argue they make less than some of the educators at nearby districts and they want their fair share. But the issue here is that Oakland Unified faces a budget deficit and is in partial receivership -- meaning an outside party monitors their finances. If Oakland Unified gives teachers what they want, they'll have to make cuts elsewhere. So the timing is not good.

We have team coverage on the wind ... ABC7 News Anchor Dion Lim is monitoring the damage in San Francisco....
 Let's go right to ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey live in Redwood City...
Dustin...
High winds are already causing problems across the Bay Area as our latest winter storm approaches.
ABC7 News reporter Dustin dorsey is live with how PG&E is preparing.
Dustin?
As we were driving around the San Carlos area today we saw traffic lights out… multiple trees down and the wind whipping through the area.
We're thankfully not expecting as much rain as we saw in January… but that's not what experts are worried about for the next few days.
Even before the rain and cold arrived for our latest winter storm… high winds made its not so welcome return to the Bay Area.
Arborist Robert Apolinar that means we could see a lot of downed trees.
Unlike our January storms… evergreen trees may be most at risk because it's not the rain that's the biggest concern… it's the wind.
We've already seen examples of that today… Up and down the peninsula and across the region… trees ripped down by gusty conditions.
Some of these trees pulling power lines down with them.
That puts PG&E on high alert over the coming days.
After the region saw mass outages in January… they are not taking any chances for this storm.
Their stockyard in San Jose was filled with replacement power lines.. poles and transformers.
PG&E says there are simple steps to prepare for outages like having batteries ready and phones charged… but tree preparation is much harder and it's too late for preventative work.
Apolinar says looking out for warning signs of trees that may be prone to failure… like dead branches or limbs that stretch away from the trunk… may be the best way to prepare for what's to come.
Sound advice there and I suggest folks here in the peninsula to heed that warning. You can see the trees bending in many places and I don't anticipate we've seen the last of downed trees.
In San Carlos Dustin dorsey ABC7 News.

And she pointed out Californians voted for Senator Bernie Sanders...who is five years older than her... in the 2020 presidential primary. Now I also asked her about a recent report that said she saw herself as a transitional candidate. She denied that...and would not commit to only serving one term. she said the only thing she would committ to is winning the election and getting things done. in the newsroom liz kreutz abc7 news.

 High winds are already causing problems across the Bay Area as our latest winter storm approaches.
 ABC7 News reporter Dustin dorsey is live with a look at the damage.
 Dustin?
 As we were driving around the San Carlos area today we saw traffic lights out… multiple trees down and the wind whipping through the area.
 We're thankfully not expecting as much rain as we saw in January… but that's not what experts are worried about for the next few days.
Even before the rain and cold arrived for our latest winter storm… high winds made its not so welcome return to the Bay Area.
 Arborist Robert Apolinar that means we could see a lot of downed trees.
We've already seen examples of that today… Up and down the peninsula and across the region… trees ripped down by gusty conditions… including in Redwood City where a Toyota Tundra was crushed.
 Some of these trees even pulling power lines down with them.
 Unlike our January storms… Apolinar said evergreen trees may be most at risk and not because of the rain…
PG&E says they have crews on standby throughout the region because they are anticipating thousands of outages.
They say to take steps now to prepare for the chance that you may end up without power in the next few days.
And the best advice from Apolinar… don't park underneath trees with these conditions so you don't end up like that Tundra.
In San Carlos Dustin Dorsey ABC7 News.

Tilden Regional Park in Berkeley caught heavy snowfall earlier today.
Big white flakes were seen falling on the road for a short period of time.
Some came together to make a snowman, while others launched snowballs at each other.
It was a delightful experience for residents...some calling it a winter wonderland. 
Don Arbor from Berkeley said it's been 30 years since he's seen snow in the area.

 
Other areas like Grizzly Peak in Berkeley, and Joaquin Miller Park in Oakland had snowfall today.
We saw all kinds of wildlife venturing out today.
Up on Mission Peak in Fremont, Sky7 spotted a coyote walking through the snow.
It looked up at the chopper but that didn't seem to bother the coyote one bit.
Highway 17 is back open tonight--after being closed for hours due to the snowy weather.
The Santa Cruz highway was shut down Southbound at bear Creek Road, and Northbound in Scotts Valley at Granite Road
The closures on highway 17 were caused by icy roads, stuck cars, and downed powerlines.
One powerline fell down, landing across all four lanes of the roadway.
CalTrans said there were at least 14 toppled trees as well.
Some residents were shocked from how empty the roads were today.

 
Lanes going in both directions were opened back up just after 3P-M today.
A CHP spokesperson recommends for drivers slow down on slushy or icy roads, to avoid spinouts.
All the snow has made for dangerous conditions in the Sierra.
A big accident earlier in the day shut down traffic on westbound 80 for a while... it has since reopened.
Numerous spin outs in other locations have led to traffic being held at times as crews come in to clear the roadway.
Chains are required on 80 from three miles east of Gold Run all the way to the stateline.
On Highway 50 they're needed from Placerville to Meyers.

Well yesterday people had to drive  back roads past Boulder Creek to get to play in snow... but today that was impossible for most of the day.
Highway 17 was shut down until about 30 minutes ago due to downed trees and  power lines... as well as icy road conditions
((After a solid dumping of snow... people across the Bay Area flocked to the Santa Cruz Mountains.
But as ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains... they were quickly disappointed to learn they can't go see it.
He's live along Highway 17 to explain why... Dustin?
Well yesterday people had to drive backroads past Boulder Creek to get to play in snow... but today that was impossible for most of the day.

A near picture-perfect scene of white in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
A great sight from afar... but the problem is... no one could get any closer to see it.
Highway 17 was closed due to wintry conditions... Southbound at Bear Creek Road and Northbound in Scotts Valley at Granite Road.
Closures on 17 are not uncommon... Southbound was closed for an entire day last month.
But residents say this time is different.
Only a few cars and trucks came up to the closure... just to be turned back around.
Anthony Dariano lives nearby and was on his way to work in San Jose... but he wasn't sure if he would be able to make it back home later.
But CalTrans says it's not just snow on the ground... there were at least 14 trees down along the highway and these pictures show hazardous conditions across towns in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
This video was shot before the closure... showing slushy and dangerous driving conditions.
CHP Officer John May says if you're on a road like this... slow down to avoid a spinout.
Until the roadways open up... things will remain slow on 17.
And residents say that means it will be a slow day for them as well.
((Traffic moving smoothly now... both northbound lanes are open and one southbound.

Did you hear that? Permission to play hooky the next time it snows!  By the way one woman in that running video is known as the "Queen of the Tam" and once did a 100 mile run up 16 summits in 34 hours.  So yes...a little snow did NOT get in her way today. Kristen.

Despite the effect on the roads, some of the county's highest elevations were the most popular for people in search of snow.
 ABC7 News reporter Zach Fuentes is live now on Skyline Boulevard in San Mateo County with more.
So much of the snow we saw yesterday in other parts of the Bay Area wasn't accumulating at this time yesterday, but as you can see here...it still looks like winter.
The snow did cause some hazards on the road for drivers but for the most part, all have been enjoying it.
Snow like this is a sight we so rarely get to see in the Bay Area - so rare, that locals wanting to sled down a hill had to improvise by using boards meant for the ocean.

As we drove on Skyline Boulevard in San Mateo County, we came across several broken trees, downed branches and falling power lines.
 It was pretty crazy. Trees were falling. We actually thought we were gonna get locked up there.
Caltrans urging everyone who wants to trek through conditions like these to drive safe.
 this is very rare for us in the Bay Area to receive such beautiful snow, but we have to be mindful and be safe and we're out there on the roadways. So just pay attention to the road. Pay attention to the signs and use caution.
In the meantime crews have been working steadily to keep the roads safe for people to continue enjoying the rare weather.
 our maintenance crews are out on the highways now doing the best that they can to clear any fallen trees off the roadways, as well as clear as and clear the ice or snow.

People who live in the Santa Cruz Mountains are under a Winter Storm Warning as more snow comes down. 
Since January, the mountains have endured heavy rain, powerful winds, and now... snowfall.
Yesterday, people were stocking up on bottled water, canned food, and fire wood. 
One Ben  Lomond woman says she's preparing in case she loses electricity. 

 
Residents are also keeping a close eye on trees near their homes -- since heavy snow can cause tree limbs to snap.


The last time it snowed in the Santa Cruz Mountains was in February of 2019. 
weather-driven power outages are *still having an impact on people across the bay area, specifically for those on the Peninsula.
Here is a live look at PG&E's power outage map. 
At last check - a little more than 21-thousand Bay Area homes and businesses are without power -- Virtually *all of them on the Peninsula. 
Yesterday, Highway 101 was temporarily shutdown in *both directions during rush hour, due to a damaged power pole in   Menlo Park.
Everything was back open just before 5 p-m, But some in the   Menlo Park and East   palo Alto area have been without power since Tuesday.
We have had our eyes across the state looking for signs of snow since it started coming down.
Everywhere from the  Carmel Valley down into the higher elevations of San Diego County.
It's hitting from Oregon to the Mexico border.
Just about everyone who lives in California will likely be able to see snow on peaks near them today.
Napa County is also seeing snow.
This is what it looked like last night in  Angwin -- snow was coming down thick.
Angwin is officially at 1749 feet above sea level, but snow fell even below that altitude. 
We spoke to a resident who was taking in the beauty of it all. 


Our team saw a number of drivers along Deer Park Road pulled over take pictures and make snow angels. 
The  CHP did pull alongside them saying "Get back in your car and keep going" -- because these are hazardous conditions. 
The snow has been dense enough to cause a number of road closures on highway 29.
Take a look at this new video from Highway 17 in the santa cruz mountains.
You've heard it over and over again this morning-- be careful if you are driving. 
We're seeing snow and ice on the roadways... highway 17 has been closed in both directions.

New developments.
Oakland's former police chief has filed an official appeal -- just one week after the city's mayor fired him.
LeRonne Armstrong's attorney says the appeal will trigger a review of Armstrong's case by the city.
That review will result in a recommendation to either uphold Armstrong's firing... or not.
We asked Mayor Sheng Thao about her decision to fire Armstrong yesterday on ABC7 News at 4.


We also asked the mayor about the ransomware attack impacting city operations and what's being done about it.
the mayor says the city is working around the clock to resolve the current issues and get all systems back up and running.
The next court date for the man accused of attacking Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's husband has been set for April.

but in recent years has become a spot where  unhoused people live in encampments.
Friday an appeals court ruled construction cannot move forward until issues with the environmental impact report are addressed.
That report says the U-C Berkeley failed to consider loud, noisy student parties... something some neighbors call a "longstanding problem."
Attorney "Thomas  Lippe" "" LIP- ee"" helped in the lawsuit that led to the project being put on hold.

 
Last summer, protesters took on police in an attempt to stop construction at the park.

Holmes already got her sentence delayed once, to April.
Her attorneys are trying to get it delayed again, until *after her appeal is complete.
Prosecutors argue it should not be delayed -- because they claim Holmes is a flight risk.

Hello, I'm Julian Glover.
And I'm Kristen Sze.
PARTS OF THE EAST BAY COULD SEE MORE THAN A HALF INCH OF RAIN. 
A major milestone today in the pandemic.
California is ending its public health emergency for  COVID-19.
It comes almost exactly three years after the declaration was first issued, giving Governor Newsom wide ranging power to slow the spread of the virus.
While the government's response to the virus is changing, some rules will not.
Masks will still be required inside healthcare and long-term care facilities.
At the same time the emergency is ending, Bay Area lawmakers are demanding transparency from China -- after a new government report said  COVID-19 likely leaked for a lab in Wuhan.


"Congressman Ro Khanna" ""con-uh"" says China should be transparent on the origins of COVID because viruses do not recognize borders.
Happening Now in Daly City, emergency crews have just put out gas fire outside a home.
It had been burning for nearly 12 hours.
The fire broke out Gellert Boulevard.
Right now, the road is still shutdown from Verducci ""Ver-do-chee"" to King Drive.
But it's expected to open up shortly.
P-G-and-E crews just finished securing the six inch gas line involved in the fire.
The Battalion Chief on scene says the call came in shortly before eleven last night forcing about a dozen neighbors to evacuate and others to shelter in place.
Now that the fire is out people are being allowed back home.
The Battalion chief says it took hours to put out the fire because P-G-E crews had to dig out and cap both sides of the six inch gas line.

 
We are told it will still take several hours for P-G-and-E crews to finish fixing the gas line.
The Red cross is providing housing for two people displaced by the fire.
There are no reports of injuries.

We will have to wait at least another week to find out if leaders in San Francisco will vote to support legalized sex work.
The board of supervisors opted to delay discussion until next week.
Their resolution would urge Governor Newsom and state lawmakers to legalize prostitution in California.
But the entire debate may be useless.
The deadline to introduce any actual new state legislation was more than a week ago.
Any state law would pave the way for legalized sex work in the city.
The idea has gained momentum as leaders try to deal with sex workers on Capp Street in the Mission District.
Our ABC7 News I-team has been all over the Capp Street saga and the topic of sex work in San Francisco... as well as in Oakland.

You're watching "Getting Answers" on ABC7.
Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today we have the leader of a new group in San Francisco that's been getting a lot of attention... they say they know exactly why San Francisco is broken, and how to fix it... we'll introduce you to Together SF Action.
Also ...with the COVID emergency ending in the Bay Area... many cities and counties will be lifting the moratorium on evictions. Our media partner, the San Francisco Standard, has the story of a landlord on a hunger strike, begging to be heard as he nears bankruptcy.
But first ... today is the last day of the COVID health emergency for the state of California... nearly three years after the pandemic began.
We checked for you ... and all Bay Area counties, including Santa Cruz ... are also lifting their county-level public health emergencies today.
But what does it really mean? Is the health emergency truly over?
Joining us live now is Dr. Abraar Karan "" Ah-brar Kah-rahn "", Infectious Disease Doctor and Researcher at Stanford University.
**are you surprised the state and bay area counties ended their emergencies before the federal government, which ends in May?
**would you have continued it?
**lots of policies will change... for example, requirements that employers provide additional COVID sick days, eviction moratoriums, required isolation, masking even in hospital settings if you're not staff
**Should people be worried about COVID anymore? why? cases stable and deaths low? most people have immunity
**what does ending the emergency mean for our day to day lives? what changes? 
**Will vaccines/tests still be readily available and free? for now while there's a federal stockpile, but what about later on? ok if you have insurance
**who still needs to wear masks? mandated? optional? your recommendations?
**how important are vaccines and boosters at this point? as you know, schools no longer require proof to enroll... same with offices
**do you know if cases will still be tracked? is it important?
**Will Medi-Cal beneficiaries be affected? Maybe lose their coverage sick people can be kicked off the program now?
**how worried are you about long COVID?
**is it still important to stay home if you have COVID? but if employers don't give you additional sick days, doesn't that incentivize you to work if you want to get paid or not use up all your limited sick leave?
**what positive changes to our healthcare system came out of the pandemic and the response?
Good afternoon
I'm Larry  Beil...
And I'm Kristen  Sze...
The stormy weather continues ... you can see it's still drizzly and grey across the bay area right now.
Dr Alok Patel is back with us here in studio once again.
*Dr. Patel ... three years later and the emergency is finally wrapping up. Are you surprised it took this long?
*So what does this mean? Obviously Covid and many variants is still around....
*Are we now just looking at Covid like it's the flu?
the energy dept issued a report saying covid most likely started with an accidental leak in a wuhan lab...
but they also said their findings were made with "low confidence."
at this point, will we ever realy know the cause and does it matter?
Thank you, Dr. Patel!
We've heard from a group of people who are confused about what exactly the end of the health emergency means for certain pandemic related policies. And to be honest, it is confusing. we asked the city about what this means in terms of food benefits, eviction protections and sick pay. here's what we learned.
And those CalFresh changes are not tied to the san francisco health order... and so that impacts every recipient in the state. 
Other changes *statewide include the closure of mass vaccination and testing sites. And that in mid-November, insurance companies will no longer be required to front the costs of covid-19 tests. 
So, Kristen, Larry... a lot of different changes...that also can vary county by county. 
A major milestone today in the pandemic.
California is ending its public health emergency for  COVID-19.
As of tomorrow ... California and all Bay Area counties will not longer be in a state of emergency...
ABC7 News anchor Liz Kreutz has been looking into some of the changes coming to San Francisco.
She joins us live...

We are getting a little bit of everything from this latest storm.
Up in the Sierra it is dumping snow -- the blizzard conditions and the threat of avalanches have closed some of the major ski resorts.
In the Bay Area it's rain we're dealing with -- and it has taken its toll.
We saw yet another mudslide today... this time in the North Bay.
We're just a few weeks shy of three years since the initial covid shutdown.
If you remember ... we didn't think it was going to last nearly this long.


and as we all know ... the shutdown went on for nearly a year ... and even longer for some businesses.
And, unfortunately, some businesses just couldn't survive and had to close for good.
Blizzard conditions and avalanche concerns closed ski resorts throughout the Lake Tahoe region today.

LIVE IN DALY CITY, LENA HOWLAND, ABC7 NEWS.
Happening today.
A group of property owners will ask the Alameda County Board of Supervisors to end an eviction moratorium.
It was put in place at the beginning of the pandemic to help renters.
Now, landlords say some tenants are using the moratorium to cheat them out of rent.


ABC7 spoke with Oakland homeowner Hannah Kirk.
She says her home may go into foreclosure because she can't evict her house mate.
Kirk isn't alone.
Joshua Howard from the California Apartment Association says the non-profit recently conducted a survey of how much property owners are owed.


Tenant advocates argue the moratorium was needed to keep people housed during the pandemic.
Howard points out the state's eviction moratorium expired last year... and so have moratoriums in other Bay Area counties and cities.
In the North Bay.
The recent rain has caused damage and erosion along some roads in the Mill Valley Area.
You can also see some redwood trees fell over power lines on Cascade Drive.
A homeowner says he heard the first tree come crashing to the ground... and the others fell moments later.


No injuries or structure damage have been reported.
Authorities say part of Cascade Drive, where hikers get access to Cascade Falls, is closed to the public for now.
In the South Bay snow is still covering the Saratoga Hills and surrounding mountains.
It's a pretty sight but has been causing a big headache for drivers who aren't prepared for the slippery conditions.
The cold, wet weather is also a big concern for the South Bay's unhoused population.
Yesterday, volunteers in San Jose spent hours delivery supplies to people living along Coyote Creek, including blankets and rain gear.

 
Advocates say some people living on the streets have been hit especially hard because they've lost supplies and had to shelter several times over this winter due to repeated flooding.
Happening now - a live look at the Caltrans camera at Interstate 80 at Castle Peak --- where it is closed top traffic this morning.
Both Interstate 80 and Highway 50 have had closures over the past day due to the conditions.
When the roads are open -- chains have been required.
Getting over the mountains the past few days has proven quite difficult for many drivers.
But it's not just the conditions making it hard -- the CHP says drivers have been showing up unprepared.


And it's not just about having the right equipment -- Caltrans and the CHP point out chains have to be put on the right tires for them to work properly.
A major milestone today in the pandemic.
California is ending its public health emergency for COVID-19.
It comes almost exactly three years after the declaration was first issued, giving Governor Newsom wide ranging power to slow the spread of the virus.
While the government's response to the virus is changing, some rules will not.
Masks will still be required inside healthcare and long-term care facilities.
At the same time the emergency is ending, Bay Area lawmakers are demanding transparency from China -- after a new government report said COVID-19 likely leaked for a lab in Wuhan.

 
"Congressman Ro Khanna" ""con-uh"" says China should be transparent on the origins of COVID because viruses do not recognize borders.
Back to our storm watch coverage now.
We'll start in the East Bay -- where there's more snow on Mount Diablo.
This video is from yesterday around noon... snow was falling fast.
The snow shutdown several roads in the park...
But it didn't stop one family from enjoying the unfamiliar bay area snowfall.


If you're headed to the mountain today, be cautious when driving on the roads.
Rain is making a mudslide near the north gate worse.
Blizzard conditions and avalanche concerns in the sierra are making the roads impassible.
And closer to home conditions are still unsettled this evening. 
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Ama Daetz.
As some of the heaviest rain moves out for now, we're looking at the problems left behind.
We have ABC7 news team coverage.. tracking the issues on the roads.. and challenges for wine makers...
But we begin with ABC7 news meteorologist Sandhya Patel for the latest on the conditions.. 
In the east bay... most of the snow that fell yesterday has now melted... 
But that, coupled with the howling winds, and heavy rain today, has been challenging for grape growers in the the Livermore Valley.
ABC7 news reporter Leslie Brinkley spent the day with a winemaker to get a sense of what they're dealing with. 
 A walk in this cabernet sauvignon vineyard in the hills of Livermore wine country is eyeopening- snow on the mountains, mud on the ground- still dormant vines- and not much work to be done right now in  this cycle of rain,frost, wind and repeat. 
The rains soak and then run off the hillside vineyards. This winemaker is more worried about vineyards in flatter areas like south of San Jose or east into Lodi. Deep puddles that sit for too long can cause root rot. Everywhere 2023 is  turning into a real wildcard of a wine year so far. Growers are Delaying pruning to inhibit frost damage- and hoping things warm up in the next month even though the weather models forecast continued cold rainy weather ahead. If it's still like this come April 1, there could be real problems.
In the south bay, road conditions are also treacherous... with downed trees and snow.
ABC7 News Reporter Lauren Martinez joins us live from felton with the latest.. 
New details on the effort to legalize prostitution in San Francisco... the proposal is set for a key vote today.
Any minute now, San Francisco Supervisors are expected to vote on a resolution urging the governor and state lawmakers to legalize prostitution in the state.
If that happens, it paves the way for San Francisco to legalize it.
Earlier this month, Supervisor Hillary  Ronen introduced the resolution. 
The idea gained momentum as city leaders try to deal with sex workers on Capp Street in the Mission District. 
The City of San Francisco has passed nearly 3-million dollars in funds to renovate one of the hotels which was used to house the homeless during the pandemic. 
ABC7 News anchor Dion Lim has the details. 
As San Francisco ends its COVID state of emergency Tuesday -- the hotel industry is bracing to welcome back tourism and guests at the city's 30-thousand some odd rooms.  
According to the city's hotel council, occupancy went from a pre-pandemic high of 80% to low of 8%.  The 2022 year ended just shy of 60% occupancy.
Also on Tuesday... the San Francsico Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a 2-point-9-million dollar settlement for the Tilden Hotel. It comes after a lawsuit by the hotel's parent company -- alleging property damage caused by "shelter-in-place" guests during the pandemic.
I spoke to a former employee of the hotel— who didn't want to go on camera…but says the homeless guests created a mess. Destroying the walls, flooring, and even televisions.
(File PKG) In 2022, ABC7 News Insider Phil Matier toured one of the hotels -- used the house the 4-thousand un-housed. He also spoke to those who enjoyed their new temporary housing.
 "It's a great place, I mean off the streets, anything off the streets is great".
When we stopped by Hotel Tilden…which advertises itself online as the "best hotel in San Francisco" -- to learn more about how funds will be used in their renovation… and discovered it closed. 
Calls to their PR company were also unanswered. In SF, DL ABC7 News.
Dueling rallies today took place over Alameda County's eviction moratorium.
ABC7 news was there in Oakland as those who want the ban to end gathered to urge the board of supervisors to take action at its meeting today.
They say the moratorium has hurt some landlords because they've be unable to collect rent for nearly three years.
Later in the same location a group supporting keeping the ban in place held its own rally.
It wants the board to provide protection for tens of thousands of tenants.
At last check the board was still meeting and no action had been taken.
Interstate 980 could become history, according to a report by our media partners at the East Bay Times.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funding is going to allow Caltrans to study if knocking down the freeway would help reconnect neighborhoods in West Oakland.

Several redwood trees near Cascade Falls of Mill Valley fell because of the mix of recent weather hitting the bay area.
You can see the redwood trees that fell down over power lines on Cascade Drive.
A homeowner says he heard the first tree crash down, which forced the other trees to fall, affecting the power lines.

A major milestone today in the pandemic.
California is ending its public health emergency for  COVID-19.
It comes almost exactly three years after the declaration was first issued, giving Governor Newsom wide ranging power to slow the spread of the virus.
While the government's response to the virus is changing, some rules will not.
Masks will still be required inside healthcare and long-term care facilities.
At the same time the emergency is ending, Bay Area lawmakers are demanding transparency from China -- after a new government report said  COVID-19 likely leaked for a lab in Wuhan.

 
"Congressman  Ro  Khanna" ""con-uh"" says China should be transparent on the origins of COVID because viruses do not recognize borders.
We'll start in the East Bay -- where there's more snow on Mount  Diablo.
This video is from yesterday around noon... snow was falling fast.
The snow shutdown several roads in the park...
But it didn't stop one family from enjoying the unfamiliar bay area snowfall.

california's covid emergency ends today.
what you'll notice will be different tomorrow.
it's not done yet!
live doppler seven still lit up with today's storm that continues to bring rain and snow to the bay area.
In some ways, this is a symbolic moment... but in other ways there are very real changes. 
Those changes also vary county by county.
one group in san francisco has been calling for more answers about what the end of the emergency means... specifically when it comes to things like food benefits, eviction protections and sick pay. we asked the city...and got some answers.
And those CalFresh changes are not tied to the san francisco health order... and so that impacts every recipient in the state. 
Other changes *statewide include the closure of mass vaccination and testing sites. And that in mid-November, insurance companies will no longer be required to front the costs of covid-19 tests. 
So... a lot of different changes...that do vary by county... 
so where does san francisco go from here?
let's bring in abc7 news insider phil matier to continue our conversation.


phil, what's your diagnosis for the city?








phil, what is it going to take to get the city going again? to get people back on bart? to get workers on their lunch breaks into restaurants?






HOW MUCH MORE stormy weather SHOULD WE EXPECT?
HERE'S THE EXPERT - ABC7 NEWS METEOROLOGIST SANDHYA PATEL.
Let's put these in three buckets.  First I'm going to tell you what we suspected about our recovery, then economists tell us what needs to happen and why, they say, this is the beginning of the future for the Bay Area. 
The economists at today's meeting pointed out that while business diversity is a good idea,  tech is what is going to move the needle toward the Bay Area's economic recovery.
In order to measure that recovery, this kind of data will be updated every three months by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.

California is ending its public health emergency for COVID-19.
It comes almost exactly three years after the declaration was first issued, giving Governor Newsom wide ranging power to slow the spread of the virus.
While the government's response to the virus is changing, some rules will not.

Our other focus....
New court filings show Fox News Chairman Rupert Murdoch now acknowledges some of the network's most famous stars endorsed false claims about election fraud in 2020.
"Dominion Voting Systems" is suing Fox News for one-point-six billion dollars.
It says the network hurt its business by allowing some hosts, and former President Trump's lawyers, to claim the voting machines rigged the election.
The network responded, saying it was "covering and commenting on allegations by a sitting president."


Fox has tried to get this case dismissed on First Amendment grounds.
But for now, a trial is set for April.

ABC7 NEWS REPORTER LENA HOWLAND HAS A LOOK AT THESE TRICKY CONDITIONS.
Pot holes have been popping up across the Bay Area thanks to the recent storms.
Mayor "Sheng  Thao" says the city of Oakland will soon start its annual "pothole blitz", once streets dry out from the rain.
In Martinez, make sure to be really careful if you're driving along interstate 680
Multiple drivers didn't see a pothole there, and ended up with damaged cars.

 
More potholes are expected in the area as more rain comes in, creating loose soil underneath the pavement.
San Francisco Supervisors have delayed votes on some key issues facing the city -- including a resolution calling for a sanctioned red light district.
The resolution would urge Governor Newsom and state lawmakers to legalize sex work in California.
Discussion was delayed to next week -- but any action by Supervisors would have little impact in the short term.
The deadline to introduce new state legislation this year passed more than a week ago.
San Francisco would need the state to legalize sex work before a sanctioned red light district could be formed.
The idea has gained momentum as leaders try to deal with sex workers on  Capp Street in the Mission District.
THIS MORNING - Interstate 80 is closed from  Applegate all the way to the state line because of the bad weather.

The rainy weather has brought some concerns to our local vineyards.
One grower in  Livermore says he is getting worried about the upcoming grape season if the rain keeps up like this.

 
The snow on the mountains and mud on the ground is causing the vines to remain dormant.
Growers are delaying pruning to prevent any frost damage.
Deep puddles can also rot roots if the water sits too long.
Winemakers are hoping for the weather to clear up by April 1st or they say it could cause problems.
This morning, we're learning more about a recent attack in San Francisco's MIssion District.
You may remember, a couple was left with bruises and fractures... and the wife with a severely  damamged eye.
The two were out for a walk last month on 18th street between Church and Dolores.
New surveillance video used in the investigation shows the couple in red walking down the sidewalk.
Then you see one of the suspects, a teenage girl, on an electric scooter.
Police say she hit the couple with the scooter-- then began attacking them.
Later, another teen joins in the attack.
Police say both teenage girls are now in custody at the S-F Juvenile Center facing a number of felony charges.
A major decision "could" be coming today in the case of a San Francisco police officer involved in a fatal shooting,
Activists who staged this rally say District Attorney Brooke Jenkins will decide today whether she'll dismiss manslaughter charges against former Officer Chris Samayoa "" Saw- my- yoa"" in the 20-17 shooting death of 42-year old Keito O'Neill.
Samayoa "" Saw- my- yoa"", just four days on the job, fired his gun through the window of his patrol car - killing the carjacking suspect, who was unarmed.
Today O'Neil's aunt demanded justice, saying police officers must be held accountable. 

 
Last Month, Jenkins announced that she planned to dismiss the charges unless California Attorney General Rob Bonta agrees to take over the case.
She blames a conflict of interest in her office's involvement, claiming her predecessor, Chesa Boudin,  sought the manslaughter charges for quote "political reasons and not in the interests of justice, " that's according to a report last month by K-Q-E-D.
Boudin filed charges against Samayoa in 2020, the first-ever case against a San Francisco police officer for a fatal shooting.

New developments this morning in a push for more protections for formerly incarcerated people in Alameda County. 
Last night the fair chance housing ordinance failed at the board of supervisors meeting. 
The ordinance would have banned landlords in the county from performing background checks on prospective tenants.
The measure was passed on its first reading in december-- but failed during the second reading.
The unexpected death of Alameda County Supervisor Richard Valle last month changed the balance of the board. 
Passge of the measure would have been a win for formerly incarcerated people who have a tough time securing housing after being released. 
Some landlords were against the measure. 
Oakland and Berkeley have successfully passed similar protections.

The motive?
Investigators say the plot was hatched because the two thought democrats had stolen the Presidential election from Donald Trump.
Days of snow on Mount Hamilton have made for dangerous driving and constant shoveling.

But first ... BART is facing a crisis. With a looming budget deficit, rising crime, slumping ridership, and service reliability issues... one state lawmaker says no more.
Orinda demcoratic state senator Steve Glazer announced yesterday... he's stepping down from the newly-formed Senate Select Committe on Bay Area Public Transit. 
In this tweet... he said "I'm not going to serve on a cheerleading panel for BART."
State Senator Steve Glazer joins us now to talk more about his decision, and his views on what ails the Bay Area's largest transit agency.
**you've been a watchdog and sometimes critic of BART's operations... a lot of people are asking... why are you resigning from a position where you'd have some influence?
**your tweet said won't grant necessary powers to the independent office meant to oversee them... that is an office you helped create in exchange for your support of a measure in 2018 that raised bridge tolls to fund transit... do you regret supporting the measure?
**why is fiscal oversight at BART so needed? give us some examples of recent incidents... employee got $2M contracts shortly after leaving job, wage theft, homeless outreach that cost $350,000 that resulted in one confirmed person getting services.
**in what ways has BART been failing the riding public? taxpayers? train cancellations on platforms 5 times what they were pre-pandemic... ridership still below pre-pandemic... crime is up, show graphic... requiring a doubling of police presence... how to fix?
**are you going to oppose more money for BART? They're going to be in a hole that some estimates put at $300M when federal dollars run out
**you call this committee a "showpiece for boosters of more transit funding" made up of "enablers for letting this open sore continue on." Wow... strong words. 
**should we fear doomsday service cuts... that could hurt the economy and working people
**do other Bay Area agencies have similar problems?
**the governor vetoed a bill that would have given the BART office of the inspector general more powers... you're trying again with another bill?
**ultimately, why is fixing BART so important?

ABC7 News Meteorologist Sandhya Patel is here with the forecast.
District Attorney Brooke Jenkins filed a motion today to officially dismiss manslaughter charges against a former San Francisco police officer involved in a 20-17 fatal shooting.
Rookie officer Chris  Samayoa "" Saw- my-   yoa"" fired his gun through the window of his patrol car, killing Keito O'Neil, a 42-year old carjacking suspect, who was unarmed.
Former D-A  Chesa Boudin initially charged Samayoa with homicide.
It was the first time a San Francisco police officer had ever been charged with homicide.
But Jenkins says the facts and laws don't support prosecution , and claims Boudin only filed charges for political gain. 
The case isn't over, though.
Today a judge gave the State Attorney General's office until March seventh to decide to file charges.
Today at a rally, O'Neil's aunt demanded justice,  saying police officers must be held accountable

Happening today.
San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins is expected to officially drop manslaughter charges against a former police officer accused of murdering a carjacking suspect in 20-17.
The case is the first time an on-duty officer had been charged with a killing but Jenkins said last month she believes the charges were "politically motivated."
A group of activists plan to protest the decision this morning.
They say Jenkins quote "refuses to hold officers accountable." 
In Oakland, supporters of Mayor Sheng Thao are standing by her decision to part ways with police chief Leronne Armstrong.

 
A rally yesterday was hosted by the Oakland Progressive Alliance.
Today marks two weeks since Armstrong's firing.
He's accused of failing to properly act on the misconduct by one of his officers.
Armstrong maintains he did nothing wrong -- and has demanded his job back.
Supervisors unanimously agreed to delay a vote on a proposal to end *virtual public comment at weekly meetings.
Virtual comments started because of COVID-19.
If the change is approved, you would have to show up to the meeting in-person to speak, unless you get an exemption due to a disability.
Action on an exemption to San Francisco's Sanctuary ordinance was also pushed back.
The rule prevents the city from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
The Department of Homeland Security has asked for an exemption for two fugitives charged with murder and child rape.
District Attorney Brooke Jenkins and Mayor London Breed support the exemption. 
Supervisor Hillary Ronen is against it.
She's worried the exemption could set up a legal precedent that could be used against sanctuary policies.
San Francisco Supervisors have delayed votes on some key issues facing the city -- including a resolution calling for a sanctioned red light district.

ABC7 News Reporter Dustin Dorsey explains how the city hopes it becomes a solution to saving lives.))
Safety is a basic necessity that everyone hopes for and expects.
But in the last few years in the city of San Jose... safety is not a given for people driving... biking... and especially walking city streets.
San Jose resident Joseph Sullivan is all too familiar of this struggle with cars while walking along Tully Road.
But sadly that doesn't always happen.
More pedestrians died last year than any year before in San Jose... and the overall traffic deaths set an all-time high as well.
Leaders have had enough.
The places that need special focus and care... are the priority safety corridors in the city.
The Department of Transportation believes the newly council-approved Tully Road Safety Improvement Project can be part of the solution.
The grant to fund this project will cover three miles... and will allow for safer crosswalks and bike lanes...
Median islands to allow for pedestrians to cross at their own pace...
Ways to narrow the street to slow speeds... and even a brand new traffic light at Tully and Brahms Avenue.
Construction starts in August and should take one year to complete.
It's one of two major capital projects currently in the works in the hopes to return safety back to San Jose.

The Alameda County District Attorney, Pamela Price, is reportedly adopting new rules that will reduce prison and jail time for some criminals. 
According to our media partners at the East Bay Times -- Price is blocking prosecutors from adding any sentencing enhancements in most cases.
Those enhancements would be for things like gun use and gang affiliation.
They often add years onto a defendant's sentence.
Price is also ordering prosecutors to offer probation when negotiating a plea deal.
These changes are a key part of her campaign promises of justice reform.

Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today... if downtown San Francisco is still struggling to get workers and tourists back post pandemic, why is traffic into the city so bad?
Our media partner, the San Francisco Standard, researched this and got some interesting answers.
Also ... a very special Wheel of Fortune contestant today from the South Bay... she's playing not just for herself, but for all the vision and mobility-impaired students she works with.
But first ... today is the first day with no COVID state of emergency in Alameda County... same as other Bay Area counties.
The County Health Care Services Agency tweeted yesterday... the move is "in alignment with the end of California's COVID-19 state of emergency."
Joining us live now to talk about this and other Alameda County headlines... Supervisor Lena Tam.
**What are the key changes today from yesterday in Alameda County, now that both the state and county Covid Emergency has ended?
**no more county run vaccination and testing sites? you still have supplies? 
**just cuz the local emergency declaration has ended, doesn't mean COVID has... your county health department is asking people to follow these guidelines.
**eviction moratorium has been controversial and extended to the end of april... you have small landlords on a hunger strike because they are being squeezed... how do you respond to them? 
**any other perks, benefits or assistance still being extended now that the local emergency has ended?
**Will your county require large employers to continue providing COVID specific sick leave?
**Fair Chance Housing Ordinance... your vote of a "no" in the second reading helped seal its fate... not passing. It would have banned landlords from doing background checks on prospective tenants. As you know, many advocates for the rights of formerly incacerated people say this will ensure people who have done their time won't get a fair shake in the rental market, what do you say?
**are you concerned this may lead to more homelessness at a time when the county is trying to solve that problem?

   Methodically going through a house full of explosives..
San Jose police say it could take as long as three day to make that home safe.
Good Evening, I'm Dan Ashley.
And I'm Karina Nova.
Tonight, the man who lived in that home with his wife and two children... is under arrest.
Police say there is so much explosive material in the house that they had to bring in federal resources to help.
ABC7 news reporter Zach Fuentes has been at the scene all day and joins us live with the latest.. 
Larry Hunt wanted to play his makeshift drums forever as long as he had an audience and that he did. Tourists would stop to listen to the "bucket man," as he was affectionately known. In 2009, he confronted those businesses near Union Square who called him and a few other street performers a public nuisance.
Hunt, 64 years old died yesterday. The medical examiner has yet to determine the cause of death. 
ABC7 news spoke to his partner of 12 years. 
He made a cameo appearance in the movie "The Pursuit of Happyness, and proudly displayed a picture of then San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom playing his buckets. 
For years Charles Grays shared this space with the Bucket Man next to the Cable Car turn around at Powell and Market. 
Hunt was always outspoken. Here he is in 1993, fighting to keep his welfare benefits when Alameda County proposed major budget cuts.
His partner says those buckets brought meaning to his life. 
Today where the Bucket Man regularly entertained,  there is an unfamiliar silence.

We did reach out to the school district  they did not return our request for comment.

Police say the incident took place after the suspect demanded a free hot dog from the vendor.
It was the first of two attacks on vendors in a span of three days last month.
In addition to the explosive materials police say the also believe there was narcotics activity as well.
Police said that there is no public safety threat right now but did add that the home itself is still not considered safe, they did evacuate some nearby residents.
All of this just the beginning of an investigation police say has multiple layers. 
Again, police say there's no public safety threat at this time but they will send officers door to door if any additional evacuations are needed.
They say they could be on the scene for up to 72 hours.

San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins has filed paperwork to officially dismiss manslaughter charges against a former police officer involved in a deadly shooting.
In 2017, rookie officer Chris Samayoa ""Saw-my-yoa"" fired his gun through the window of his patrol car, killing Keito O'Neil, a 42-year old carjacking suspect.
Former D-A Chesa Boudin initially charged Samayoa with homicide.
It was the first time a San Francisco police officer had ever been charged with homicide.
But Jenkins says the facts and laws don't support prosecution , and claims Boudin only filed charges for political gain. 
The case isn't over, though.
a judge gave the State Attorney General's office until March seventh to decide to file charges.
at a rally yesterday, O'Neil's aunt demanded justice, saying police officers must be held accountable.


O'Neil's family settled a civil lawsuit against the city for two and a half million dollars.
Chris Samayoa was fired by the department.

Today we are talking about more hard numbers backing up the fact that downtown san francisco is really struggling...
And the lights are going out on the bay bridge this weekend... forever? 
We begin in the city...
A new report from te San Francisco's budget and legislative analyst says there are about 150-thousand fewer office workers on a given workday than before the pandemic.
Obviously the pandemic is being blamed... but also the effect of online shopping...
The most job losses are in lodging, food services and retail...

Today, we can expect another critical report on the state's snow pack levels.

The snow pack is currently outpacing the state's highest snow season in 1982 to 1983.
Friends and family are remembering a man from New York who died at Heavenly Mountain Resort in South Lake Tahoe.
46-year-old "Wesley  Whalen" died on Wednesday.
The resort confirmed it happened near an expert part of the run known as "round-a-bout."
Whalen was a strong advocate and translator for people in the deaf community.
The U-S Deaf Ski and Snowboard Association posted about his death yesterday.
Many people who knew him also shared their condolences.
The circumstances behind his death are unclear.
But it appears there are several trees in the "round-a-bout" where the incident happened.
You can already see it for yourself.

 Scientists say we still need several more wet winters in order to snap out of the drought *entirely.
There is new debate swirling after the deadly stabbing of a Santa Rosa high schooler.
Some parents are now saying the whole thing could have been prevented.
16-year-old Jayden Pienta ""pee-enta"" was the student killed during a fight at Montgomery High School Wednesday.
Another student was stabbed in the hand and is o-k.
That boy's mother says her son was assaulted by the suspect three weeks earlier.
The mother claims she met then with the school ... but says the lack of action failed her son.

 
The Santa Rosa Police Department looked into these claims, but found no cases filed by the school.
The 15-year-old freshman accused of stabbing the other students is in custody, facing felony homicide charges.
No comment today from the school district.

Let's get right to ABC7 news weather anchor Spencer Christian.
Vice President Harris met with A-A-P-I business owners during her visit.
What they say they need... and what she told them.


How the judge responded to this statement by Alex Murdaugh ""murdock"" as he sentenced him today for the killing of his wife and son.
California's pandemic health emergency just expired and now we're seeing a lot more changes.
Not only with masking, but who no longer is required to be vaccinated.
First here's a look at what's coming up tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live right after ABC7 News at 11.
Jimmy!
36-year-old Peter Karasev-- The San Jose man accused of having explosives in his *family home on Potomac Court, making his first court appearance, Friday.
Police now linking him to explosions at two P-G-and-E transformers, not far from where he lived.
This 21-page criminal complaint, bringing to light a December 8th blast that damaged a transformer on Thornwood Drive, outside Oakridge Mall.
The second happened January 5th, on Snell Avenue and Santa Teresa Boulevard--
Where detectives noted damage to a nearby building, including multiple broken windows.
At least one-thousand customers went without power. 
Detectives credit cell phone data, video from a parked tesla, and police surveillance-- 
Tying Karasev to the two scenes and leading to his home.
Following his arrest on Wednesday, police say a search of his home turned up a large amount of explosive materials--
And what they describe as an *inactive a meth lab. One with finished product. 
Police say Karasev admitted to using methamphetamine as a replacement for Adderall during the Adderall shortage. 
Additionally, the complaint details the suspect's interest in model rockets and setting some off outside his home.
Investigators say he also admitted to having a difficult time with the war between Russia and Ukraine, since he has family in both countries.
A motive is still not known.
Cameras were not allowed in court, but ABC7 was there as a public defender revealed details of Karasev's life-- attempting to get him out on supervised release. 
They say Karasev is a software engineer at Zoox -- a company that develops self-driving cars.
He's also a married father of three. His children... ages 1, 3 and 5... also live at the home in question.
Among the nine felony counts he's facing-- igniting a destructive device, arson, child endangerment and possessing bomb-making materials.
Only days after this massive response, the scene around the family's home remains active, with both federal and local agencies on site.
In the North Bay...Students held a walk out today after a high schooler died in a stabbing.
Students at Maria Carrillo high school in Santa Rosa rallied for more safety on campus.
It's in response to Wednesday's fatal stabbing of 16-year-old Jayden Pienta "" pee-enta"" at Montgomery High School.
This prompted students to demand more action from the school to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A friend of Jayden expressed her concern.

 
The 15-year-old freshman accused of stabbing Jayden, and another student, have since been arrested. 
The storm expected this weekend will dump more snow in the Sierra Mountains.
That and the already above-average snow levels on the ground could break the existing record set forty years ago.  
Today the California Department of Water Resources carried out the third Sierra snow survey of the season at Phillips Station near Lake Tahoe.
Managers found the the snow depth was just over 116 inches and the water content was 41 and a half inches. 
That puts the snow pack level at 177-percent of average. 

 
Last week's rain and snow boosted the numbers after a month long dry spell in February.
The next survey will be in April.
New developments out of San Jose tonight, tying the man accused of having explosive materials in his home to two separate transformer blasts. 
The first explosion damaged a transformer on  Thornwood Drive on December eighth, not far from OakRidge Mall.
The second, nearly a month later, on Snell Avenue at Santa Teresa Boulevard.
"Peter Karasev" ""care-uh-sev"" made his first appearance in court today, where he was denied bail. 
ABC7 News Reporter Amanda del Castillo has the new details.
It's a snowy scene in San Bernadino County where road closures are making it difficult to get around in the mountains. 
This video shows a trapped person sending out a very creative S.O.S--saying "Help Us."
Roads have been closed all day between crestline and arrowhead because of this week's storm.
Cars were backed up since this morning as Caltrans escorted residents and deliveries.
Some cars got stuck on the way up...which caused even more delays.
One resident anxiously waited to get home to his wife, who's disabled. 

 
Some homes in the area had gas lines rupture...one home even exploded. 
Officials say it may take up to a week in some areas for the sun to melt the ice.
Vice President Kamala Harris returned to the Bay Area today for a small business round table and a fundraiser.  
ABC7 news anchor Dion Lim was the only TV journalist to go one on one with the vice president.
The Vice President's husband is also in town.
Second Gentlemen Douglas  Emhoff joined NASA officials at East Oakland Youth Development Center this afternoon.
They talked about making NASA more inclusive... one example being the Artemis Mission, which will take a person of color and woman to the moon for the first time. 
Emhoff also talked about one issue important to the Vice President... climate change... saying scientists will be crucial to finding solutions.


Students received hands on STEM Learning Lunchboxes.
The kits provide five activities for students to learn about space.
Some 30-thousand boxes are being distributed as part of a program for under served youth in urban and rural communities. 
New Developments with the ransomware attack that happened in Oakland last month.
The hacker group "Play" took responsibility for the breach on city services' data.
According to SF-Gate, "Play" plans to release private documents, obtained during the hack, to the public.
Those files include passports, IDs, financial documents, and other personal information. 
City officials say they're working with authorities to validate the group's claims.  
A man was arrested after a wild chase in Southern California.
Take a look as this video...the suspect looked to be holding an assault riffle and shooting at police officers.

 
Chino Police said the suspect crashed into another car, but refused to stop.
It ended in Harbor City, when the driver struck a pole and tried to take off on foot.
He then appeared to try to take another car... but was quickly detained and taken into custody.
Police say the man is the suspect in a carjacking.

Every day, we talk with experts about issues important to the Bay Area, and get answers for you in real time.
Today we have The results of a new report on rideshare discrimination.
We talk to the senior staff attorney from the Asian law Caucus about workers' rights for Uber and Lyft drivers.
Also ... have you ever dreamed about making a pitch to the Sharks on "Shark Tank?"
We talk to a casting producer about what it takes to get on the show.. and to a native San Franciscan.. who takes a dive on tonight's Shark Tank.. about her products.
But first ... many commuters have concerns about the new 101 Express Lanes on the Peninsula.. with tolling just starting for the new section today. 
Joining us live now is ...Tasha Bartholomew, the spokesperson for the San Mateo County 101 Express Lanes project..
**Today is the first day of the northern section, right?... tell us about it. 
**why do this? what are the goals? raise money? relieve traffic? promote carpooling?
**From where to where, the hours
**why so long, basically all day? 5am-8pm... that's way longer than the peak hours... how do you justify non peak hours?
**cost? variable? max? why so expensive? $10 to go 3 exits through palo alto
**but when there's little traffic at say 6am, isn't it just to make money?
**The redwood ctiy to san jose portion has been open for a year now, right? how has that worked out from the traffic standpoint? made money?
**Critics have called them "Lexus Lanes" because wealthy people are able to afford these tolls.. while many others who cannot would have to sit in traffic or break the bank. what do you say to those critics?
**where did money to build and convert the lane come from? Taxpayers? 
**doesn't it punish the people who are in jobs where they are unable to work from home and have to go to the work site?
**$10/day, 5 days a week... in a year that's $2,600... even someone who makes a good salary... say $100K, how can they afford the additional expense?
**is the message in California... don't drive.... but is that fair when our public transit is not nearly as accessible and safe as many other metropolitan areas?
**what programs can help drivers who cannot afford the toll?
**what happens for drivers who don't have FasTrak?
**where do you have to keep the Fastrak in your car?
**where will the money collected from tolls go?
**is the message in California... don't drive.... but is that fair when our public transit is not nearly as accessible and safe as many other metropolitan areas?

The storm expected in the Bay Area this weekend will dump more snow in the Sierra. 
That and the already above-average snow levels could break the existing record set forty years ago.  
Today, the third snow measurement was taken and it did not disappoint. 
ABC7 news reporter Lyanne Melendez tells us how this will impact our drought conditions.
This month could well be another "Miracle March" in the Sierra Mountains.  
Today's 3rd manual survey of the season recorded 116.5 inches of snow. That's the snow water content of 41.5 inches and 177 percent of average to date. 
This is a satellite picture of California in September 2022 before the storms. This is the latest photo taken on March 3, 2023.  
The largest snow pack on record statewide was in 1982-83. 
The next measurement will be on April 3 to be exact.
On everyone's mind are the state's drought levels. 
It will take more than a good wet year to replenish those basins.
With all this snow, there is some concern that warm temperatures would produce snow melt resulting in record flooding in some areas.  
We saw this between December 1996 and January 1997 when several rivers flooded surrounding areas, forcing thousands to evacuate. 
But as of early February Oroville Dam, the second largest reservoir in the state is at 65 percent capacity. So there's little concern there. 
In the meantime, this year has been an outstanding one for the local economy.
Some may even think the season could extend to July. Lyanne Melendez ABC7 news.
Students at a Santa Rosa High School walked out today over concerns about safety in school.
This after an on-campus stabbing that killed one student, injured another, and put a third student in jail.

Drivers heading to or from the Sierra finally have some clear roads.
Both highway 50 and Interstate 80 are open without any restrictions this morning.
80 was shut down from Applegate to the Nevada Border for several days this week because of whiteout conditions.
Today, we can expect another major report on the state's snow pack levels.
The California Department of Water Resources will conduct its third Sierra snow survey of the season.
Snow pack is currently outpacing the state's highest snow season in 1982-to-1983.
The snow hasn't just been creating a danger in the Sierra.
 San Bernadino County is seeing all sorts of problems, particularly in the mountains where communities have been buried by snow.
The National Guard has arrived to help clear some of the roads after Governor Newsom declared a state of emergency.
Residents are running low on supplies, after as much as eight feet of snow fell over the past week.
Gas stations are starting to run out of fuel and those looking for food are scrambling.
There's so much snow, the roof collapsed at the only grocery store in the town of Crestline.
The store owners tried to clear the snow off of the roof, but say they just couldn't keep up.
They raced to salvage whatever food they could.
No one was hurt in the collapse.
Friends and family are remembering a man from New York who died at Heavenly Mountain Resort in South Lake Tahoe.
46-year-old "Wesley Whalen" died on Wednesday.
The resort confirmed it happened near an expert part of the run known as "round-a-bout."
Whalen was a strong advocate and translator for people in the deaf community.
The U.S. Deaf Ski and Snowboard Association posted about his death yesterday.
Many people who knew him also shared their condolences.
The circumstances behind his death are unclear.
But it appears there are several trees in the round-a-bout where the incident happened.

Good Evening, I'm Larry Beil.
And I'm Kristen Sze.

The first blast damaged a transformer on Thornwood Drive on December eighth, not far from Oak Ridge Mall.
The second, nearly a month later, on Snell Avenue at Santa Teresa Boulevard,..

We did-- it was a jam packed day...which included a fundraiser in Hillsborough, and a roundtable discussion at a library in San Francsico's Chinatown with local leaders and small Asian owned-owned businesses.

However, one of the most impactful moments was after that discussion-- when I got to talk with her one-on-one.  During this International Womens Month.  I asked what she was proud of...and the challenges being the first female vice president...and a person of color.  She shared this personal story. 


Just a week ago, the president sat down with David Muir-- and said he has every intention to run again. 
So When I asked if we'd see a Biden/Harris ticket in 2024.  She said she's be right there with him.

 Mayor Breed says the extra money is needed to pay for police overtime and to avoid a hiring freeze.

 Supervisors who oppose the increase say they want greater accountability on how the police department is spending the money.

Hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst as another round of storms close in.


Now the possibility of a warm storm melting all that snow... not just in yosemite ... but all across the sierra.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed held a rally today to urge the city to increase the police budget by 27-million dollars.
Mayor Breed says the extra money is needed to pay for police overtime and to avoid a hiring freeze.
The police budget was already increased by nearly 57 million dollars this year.
The additional funds would also pay for private security patrols, like Urban Alchemy, in areas such as the Tenderloin.

San Francisco police logged 380-thousand hours of overtime this year.
This was an area hit hard by the last atmospheric rivers and hasn't seen much of a break since, even the recent snowfall seen in some of these areas has prolonged the saturation of much of the ground here.

 it was horrible. A lot of people evacuated.

 we're still cleaning up the mess from that December, January atmospheric rivers and weather we've had after that we continue seeing impacts on our roadways. 
With impacts from the past storms still a problem, county officials are also trying to prepare residents for the near future.
 if these winds come through as predicted, that's going to take out a lot of trees when the trees come down, and they take out power. So I would expect power outages, especially if you live up in the mountains. I know residents up there do not want to hear that. But that is been a fact of life. The entire winter.
Though no one is looking forward to those possibilities, many residents tell us that they're prepared.
 we have generators, we have solar panels on our roofs. We have lots of freezers in cold rooms you know, so you need you know, for your stuff. And we have a lot of gear we have three cars. So they're all gassed just in case.
Officials say they're trying to stay optimistic that the upcoming atmospheric river won't be as bad...but it's not easy.
 we're kind of hoping and misses us. But given our track record, we're, we're probably going to take this one too.
For now, they say they're ramping up resources ahead of the expected storms. 
 we're just out there cleaning up culverts trying to make sure that those kinds of systems are functioning and doesn't lead to additional problems. We're replenishing our sandbag locations.
Though prepared...many residents say, they've had enough the rough weather.
 If it's 110 This summer, bring it on.
Santa Cruz County officials say they're continuing to keep a close watch on the forecast and are hoping that this is the last big weather event they'll have to cope with...but they're well-aware that that's only something time can determine.

The earliest possible date for Yosemite National Park to re-open to the public is next week. 
As Leslie Brinkley reports, they aren't just plowing snow but bracing for the next storm.
Yosemite shut down Feb. 25 because of blizzard after blizzard.  And now there's an atmospheric river on the way.  
The same scenario took place in  January 1997- warm rain accelerated snow melt. The runoff caused the Merced river and creeks to overflow, taking out bridges and roads, destroying half the accomodations in Yosemite National Park and half the campgrounds. 2100 visitors were stranded. The park was closed for two months. 
If all goes well, Yosemite could reopen March 13. If there is flooding, then all bets are off. It could be closed for longer. I'm Leslie Brinkley ABC7 news.

San Jose State Meteorology Professor Jan Null says after the collective storm systems hit the Bay Area over the last few months-- 
Soils are saturated, roots are saturated, and it won't take much to topple more trees. 


news of the death was shocking, but not surprising to many hikers we spoke with-- 
Though Midpeninsula Regional Open Space officials say this was the first incident of its kind in the district's 50 year history.  
Sunday morning's deadly tree fall happened along the Stephen E. Abbors ""uh-BOARS"" Trail. 
As of last night, part of the trail remained closed.

It's tragedy now underscoring the danger with this week's incoming storms.
ABC 7 News Reporter Lena Howland is live this morning with more on the warnings from emergency officials.


An emotional plea from San Francisco Mayor London Breed... as she paints a grim picture of how bad public safety could get if the board of supervisors doesn't approved the 27-million-dollar increase for the police budget.
Good Evening, I'm Ama Daetz.
And I'm Dan Ashley.
The money would be used to recruit and increase overtime pay for police officers, as well as hire more prosecutors.
ABC7 news reporter Lyanne Melendez is here and Lyanne, the mayor needs the approval of the Board of Supervisors.
Taking a live look outside right now... 
We are on storm watch this week.. with some showers in the north bay tonight.. and an atmospheric river expected thursday night.
For the details, let's go to ABC7 news meteorologist Sandhya Patel..
There are eleven supervisors and the mayor needs eight of them to sign on to this plan. It's going to be a close one but I think she may have the votes. Obviously much of the focus will be on the Tenderloin, but also attention will be given to those neighborhoods where people say they don't feel safe. 
What happens in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood often has repercussions in the rest of the city. 
At the heart of the problem is the open-air drug dealing. 
The mayor is asking supervisors to approve a 27 million dollar budget supplemental to fund police overtime citywide 
and recruit officers.  That plan would also add more prosecutors 
and extend the Ambassador program. 
The District Attorney says since she took office, the number of cases filed for drug sales has doubled, but it all comes at a cost.
The previous District Attorney, Chesa Boudin came under fire for failing to prosecute 
many drug dealers coming from Central America whom he said were themselves victims of trafficking by drug lords in their countries.
Supervisor Matt Dorsey today was heckled by a few protesters who came to defend San Francisco's sanctuary city policies at all costs.
Dorsey supports the overtime pay for officers. 
Noticeably absent was Supervisor Dean Preston who represents the Tenderloin District.  He did not respond to our request for a statement but just last week said, 
"It is preposterous that a department that got bonuses, raises, and a $50 million budget increase last summer—would come back seven months later for an additional $27.6 million." 
The police shortage has been an issue for years now. Police Chief William Scott says his department is operating at 75 percent of what has been recommended. 
Recruitment has been a challenge, but the police chief said things are beginning to change. Since November 2022 --four months ago--the number of applications to the police academy has doubled with nearly one thousand applicants. Still, the question is can they retain them?  In the newsroom, Lyanne Melendez ABC7 news. 
And as we get ready for this upcoming atmospheric river, impacts from the last round of storms are still being felt by the folks who were hit hardest.

*Today we're talking about governor Newsom taking a stand on women's rights -- by taking on Walgreens.
plus -- another incident of violence in the skies --- and it's all caught on camera.
Governor Newsom says the state of California will no longer do business with Walgreens over its new policy on abortion pills.
Newsom said "won't do business with Walgreens or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women's lives at risk."
The tweet follows the drug store chain's announcement on Friday that it will distribute the drug "Mifepristone"  ""muh-fuh-pri-stone"" only in states where it's legal and quote "operationally feasible." 
Last month, republican attorneys general in 20 states sent letters to Walgreens and C-V-S, warning them they could face legal consequences if they sell abortion pills by mail in their states.
The other story... 
A passenger who tried opening a door mid-flight, then stabbed a flight attendant with a broken spoon, is facing felony charges.
It happened on a United flight between L-A-X and Boston.
Federal investigators say 33-year-old "Francisco Torres" from Massachusetts tried moving the door handle.
When confronted - authorities say Torres attacked a flight attendant with a spoon he turned into a weapon in the bathroom.
Fellow passengers wrestled the suspect and restrained him.
United has banned him from the airline.
People living or visiting Half Moon Bay are being warned to be on the lookout for a bold and brave Mountain Lion.
The big cat has been lurking around homes and popular dog walking trails in broad daylight. 
Take a look, that's the mountain lion right there.
People living along Railroad Avenue have been catching glimpses of the big cat right on their doorsteps.
Sheriff's Deputies are also warning visitors to the  Coastside trail near Poplar Beach to be cautious. 
The first sighting was Friday. 

 
About a month ago, a mountain lion attacked a boy who was on a hiking trail, not far from Half Moon Bay. 
The boy was injured and that lion was not captured.
It is unclear whether this is the same lion.
Two years ago... multiple community safety efforts were launched in Oakland's Chinatown after numerous violent crimes.
Now it appears those efforts may be paying off.

Their formation began after merchants started reporting attack after attack.


Stats from ABC7's neighborhood safety tracker show burglaries are down citywide by 11-percent compared to the 3 year average. 
When it comes to robberies, the stats are essentially flat over the last 3 years.  
San Francisco Police officers could be in line for some pay raises.
 According to the Chronicle, the police officer's association and the city have tentatively agreed on a new contract. 
It calls for raises of a little more than 10-percent over the course of three years, to about 108 thousand dollars.
Mayor Breed has pushed for this as a critical part of helping police staffing and safety concerns in the city.
Any contract needs approval from the Board of Supervisors, which is expected to scrutinize the agreement.
The brother of San Francisco Mayor London Breed may be getting out of prison sooner than expected. 
After robbing a Marina District restaurant in June 2000, Napoleon Brown pushed the getaway car driver onto the Golden Gate Bridge where a drunk driver killed her.
Brown's murder conviction in the case was eventually reduced to manslaughter.
Brown's attorney explains the new state law requires a defendant be the actual killer, and Brown did not intend to kill the driver.
Brown will have a re-sentencing hearing on the remaining charges of robbery and carjacking.
He has a chance of being released on time served.

Yosemite National Park remains closed this morning due to non-stop storms.
The earliest possible date for the park to re-open is Monday March 13th -- and that could change.
There's an atmospheric river moving in, expected to hit the area.
Crews are plowing down the mounds of snow in the park. 
They're also setting out sandbags to brace for the next incoming storm.
Park officials say there's snow as high as six-feet in some of the parking lots.
A park spokesperson says workers are trying to widen lanes so cars can get through.

 
Officials say heavy rain at elevations up to eight-thousand feet could prompt a large snow melt event and cause widespread flooding.
The last time that happened was 19-97.
This morning, there are no restrictions on 80 or Highway 50 in the Sierra.
Chain controls were lifted yesterday, but Caltrans is reminding drivers to slow down because the roads remain slick.

Criminal defense attorney Anthony brass explains what enhancements can mean... 

 
The change means the suspects in Jasper Wu's case could receive lower sentences if they are convicted.
As for the Wu family - they tell ABC7 News they are still struggling with the grief and trauma.
They are now considering a permanent move out of California.
This morning, we're learning more about the tough conditions people are facing in Mendocino County.

Authorities say thankfully she had some food and water in her car because it wasn't until Monday that she was rescued. 
Still -- she was very cold and showed signs of dehydration. 

 
Authorities say the incident is one of many scary situations happening in Mendocino County from the recent snowstorms.

California is once again looking to limit the use of facial recognition technology by police.
A three-year ban expired at the beginning of the year.


This bill wouldn't ban its use but would not allow for arrests simply based off of a match.
It also sets a high standard for accuracy when facial recognition technology is used.
This measure would also prohibit using the tech in instances where someone might be racially profiled.
As the next round of storms moves through, you can keep track of the changing conditions *and use the same live Doppler Seven that our weather team uses.

Peterson says she'll go back when the time is right. 
Locals are also being asked to watch for possible flooding. This typically happens at lower elevations and because of all that snow, there is limited drainage and if that water doesn't have anywhere to go they could see rivers, creeks overflowing. In the newsroom, Lyanne Melendez ABC7 news.

The niners dream season ends with a philadelphia nightmare.
Good Morning.
It's Monday, January 30th.
First let's check your  forecast.
Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.
Cities across America - including Oakland - are holding rallies and demonstrations after the severe beating and death of "Tyre Nichols" in Memphis.
Video of that beating was released on Friday -- sparking outrage nationwide.
Experts say training standards for more than 18-thousand  U.S. police agencies are "inconsistent and outdated."
After the video of the brutal beating of Tyre Nichols was released - the Memphis Police Department has permanently disbanded its "Scorpion Unit."
It's short for "Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in our Neighborhoods."
It was formed in 2021 to patrol high crime areas.
Five officers from that unit have been fired and are now facing murder charges in  Nichols' death.
All are expected in court for arraignment next month.


Two Memphis Fire E-M-T's and two responding sheriff's deputies have been relieved of duty pending investigations.
Senator Dick  Durbin, who is the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is now pushing for a federal bill reforming policing to be revisited.
It previously stalled in the Senate.
We're hearing more from Nichols' family attorney Ben Crump about other incidents involving the officers. 
Here's what he told Martha Raddatz yesterday morning on "This Week." 




Crump says this man tried to report the encounter twice to the Memphis police department, but his calls were not returned.
The unit was operating as three teams of about 30 officers, which claimed to target violent offenders in areas hit by high crime.
Many of you are waking up to frost on your windshields this morning...

Our other focus....
There's a new warning for parents this morning -- about your kids and social media.
The U-S surgeon general says 13 years old is too young for children to be on social media.
To put it into perspective, most of the popular social media apps have an age requirement of 12 and up.
Only SF-based Twitter has a 17 and older requirement.
New research suggests habitually checking social media can alter the brain chemistry in kids.
The surgeon general is also concerned about age requirement enforcement.
He says social media platforms are not applying age limit protocols consistently.

A public hearing on a resolution to adopt the plan is scheduled for tomorrow. 
As we accelerate the switch to all-electric vehicles, firefighters in Sacramento County are highlighting one challenge with them... the batteries.
Crews in Sacramento had to jack up a Tesla that caught fire over the weekend... and use about six-thousand gallons of water to put out the flames.
They say the issue was that the battery cells kept burning.
Tesla has published directions for putting out a fire in one of their cars... saying battery fires can burn up to 24-hours, much longer than gas engine cars.
The driver in this case said the fire started spontaneously while they were driving on the freeway.
No injuries were reported.

LIVE IN THE NEWSROOM, LENA HOWLAND, ABC7 NEWS.
In San Francisco's ongoing battle against the drug overdose crisis, more than a dozen local leaders are in New York City  to get a look at the country's first sanctioned safe consumption.
San Francisco is hoping to open three sites by the end of the year, but the city attorney is pumping the brakes, citing legal concerns.
ABC7 news reporter Tara Campbell has been reporting on the drug overdose crisis extensively and is in New York City.
PKG 
 There are two safe consumption sites in New York City. . . one of them is right here behind me . . . both of them are operated by a non-profit called On Point.
The pace is fast . . . and the purpose is clear . . . save lives and connect drug users to services they need . . . from treatment . . . to medical care . . . a shower and laundry.
OnPoint is operating the first sanctioned safe consumption sites in the US . . . one location in Harlem and the other in Washington Heights.
These sites provide a place for people to use their drugs under the supervision of a medically-trained professional . . . there. . .  ready to reverse an overdose.
And more than a dozen of San Francisco's local leaders are taking notes.
From city supervisors . . . to the San Francisco Fire Department . . . Public Health . . .   and the nonprofits hoping to operate safe consumption sites in San Francisco.
Lydia Bransten is the Executive Director of the Gubbio Project .
 "I think the biggest take away is how intentionally everything is done. This is not a fly-by-night operation. This operation is very intentional. It's very skilled and the people here really know what they're doing."
Sam Rivera is the Executive Director of OnPoint  . . . and says properly training staff . . . is key.
 "We're not in there just letting it happen. We're really tough on how we operate these."
Since opening nearly a year-and-a-half ago OnPoint staff has overseen more than 55,000 drug injections . . . or inhalations . . . and reversed more than 700 overdoses. It has also connected more than more than 2,200 people to treatment.
 "We know that an opioid overdose is the central nervous system slowing down, eventually they stop breathing.
Rayce Samuelson is an overdose prevention specialist . . . 
 "Eighty percent of the overdoses all we have to do is put on the oxygen mask connected to one of our oxygen tanks . . .  a sternum rub, a trap squeeze, some pain stimulus . . . take a big breath, take a big breath' that's all we have to do. That's really the beauty of the site we're here with people the second the needle goes in the arm, the second the dose is taken. We're able to respond immediately, right away."
*Drug user showing the prep before injecting - no injection is shown
 "I prepared my umm . . . oh it's already in this needle."
Sam says he feels safer using his drugs under supervision.
 "It's cocaine mixed with heroin." 
 "And you're going to inject it here. 
 Yes, here  there's no better place than here." 
 "How often you come here 
 "Every day." 
 "If you weren't here where would you be? 
 Umm, basically in a bathroom by myself."
 "Now another point of interest for this group from San Francisco is what's happening on the streets outside the safe consumption sites . . . how does it impact the local neighborhoods."
 "What's going on inside is really important and saving lives, but that's not going to work if it's creating a mess outside."
Supervisor Matt Dorsey noticing . . .  clean streets . . . and very little open-air drug use.
 "One thing this organization running the overdose prevention centers in New York is absolutely committed to being a good neighbor and a good partner with the New York City Police Department."
 "It's clean now, but before there were people everywhere there were needles all over."
Fred is battling depression and addiction … and says he does access the safe consumption sites . . . and that they've also changed the streets.
 "You couldn't go to a park. Kids couldn't go to parks, it was insane, pretty much you could walk over a body that's how "bleeped" up it was. 
 And since the safe consumption site. . .  
"It's changed a lot."
 Inside safe consumption site 
Safe consumption sites are illegal under federal law, but the New York model could provide a path forward . . . these sites are funded by private donations -- not city dollars --- making the city, in theory, less liable. 
 "Supervisor Ronen you've seen these centers now in action in New York City how and do you think  this will move the ball forward in establishing sites in San Francisco?" 
 "I do because now we're going back to San Francisco with a whole army of advocates who have seen proof that these sites not only save lives but they improve neighborhood conditions."

Now at nine, rain, ice and snow across California. 
Where in the Bay Area we'll see the most rain come down today...
And the concerns as road conditions become more dangerous for drivers. 
Take a look at this, we're seeing more snow from the Level 1 storm. 
The snow came down again in Napa County on Highway 29 at Robert Louis Stevenson Park, near Calistoga.
It started to fall just after 10 a-m yesterday morning and continued for a couple of hours.

 
Caltrans have several snow plows ready to go... and began clearing the highway once the snow started falling.
Highway 29 got hit hard during last week's storm and a stretch had to close for several days.


In the Bay Area...graupel is coming down this morning... making it a risky drive in some areas. 
This is new video taken from Highway 24 in Orinda. 
You can see the ice is hitting the window pretty hard, covering the road and making it a slick drive out there. 


A winter storm topping headlines here in the bay area this morning.
Heavy snow falling in higher elevations overnight, after a lighter dusting took many by surprise yesterday.


Different parts of the bay area experiencing varying versions of the storm, but the cold air is everywhere. 
Wet roadways are in store for commuters this morning.
A look at what to expect on the roads and in the forecast.
Good morning.
It's FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24..
we're on early this morning to make sure you've got the very latest information on the storm as you wake up.
Let's begin with a check on the weather with meteorologist SPENCER CHRISTIAN.




This is not traditionally how you think of Napa County, but the snow is coming down and it is thick here in Anglin. 
You can see that behind me. Anglin is officially at 1749 feet above sea level, but we are well below that in our location. 
We have seen a number of drivers here along Deer Park Road pulled to the side of the road to take pictures to do snow angels. 
But we have also seen those with the California Highway Patrol pull alongside of them saying Get back in your car and keep going because these are hazardous conditions. It is extremely thick out here. 
You can't even see the roadways in a lot of these areas. 
But one thing is for sure it is beautiful. 
We have talked with those who live in this area and work in this area. This is what they have to say. 
"First time of watching this snow. You know I've been living here five to six years. This is the first time, it's snow."
we are also seeing a number of road closures highway 29 Connecting Calistoga to Middletown that is closed right now. 
The alternate route is here along Deer Park Road, but it's unclear how long this road will stay open. 
If this snow continues to fall, that just to give you an idea about how thick this snow is. 
You can see it doesn't take much to grab it to make a snowball and to throw it or take one of those snowballs from your photographer.

It then escalates and Tyre is heard repeatedly screaming for his mother.


Peaceful protests are happening across the country, including here in the bay area.

First let's check your  forecast.
Here's meteorologist Drew Tuma.
That's right.
There was the spy balloon from China last week -- and now three unidentified objects over the weekend.
The most recent was shot down yesterday over Lake Huron.
Senior administration officials say the octagon shaped structure was unmanned, traveling at about 20 thousand feet near sensitive sites.
So far there's no indication of surveillance capabilities for any of the objects seen over the weekend.
While there are a lot of questions about why so many objects have been detected recently -- the Pentagon tells ABC News after the spy balloon from China was discovered, NORAD turned up the sensitivity of its radars to detect smaller objects.


This latest incident comes just one day after  U.S. Fighter jet shot down an unidentified, unmanned object over Canada's Yukon territory on Saturday.
Just a day before that, another unidentified object was shot down off the coast of Alaska. 
US officials are looking for the wreckage from the object shot down in the Yukon. But so far the ice and weather conditions are hampering their efforts.

Some eagles fans got rowdy even before the super bowl began.

Since Friday, five people have been shot along International Boulevard. 
Early Saturday morning at around midnight... officers found a person who was shot near 84th and International.

New details.
A plan to build student housing on the site of the historic People's Park in Berkeley has been put on hold by a court.
The park is located just south of U-C Berkeley's campus.
It's a landmark of the 19-60's social rights movement...
but in recent years has become a spot where unhoused people live in encampments.
Friday an appeals court ruled construction cannot move forward until issues with the environmental impact report are addressed.
That report says the U-C Berkeley failed to consider loud, noisy student parties... something some neighbors call a "longstanding problem."
Attorney "Thomas Lippe" ""LIP-ee"" helped in the lawsuit that led to the project being put on hold.

 
Last summer, protesters took on police in an attempt to stop construction at the park.
In a statement to ABC7 News... U-C Berkeley says it will appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court.
