    "As a parent with two children, I can confidently say the first pregnancy definitely feels the longest. To answer the question, we have to look at the length of a normal pregnancy. The mean length of all pregnancies is 38.6 weeks with the vast majority of women delivering between 36 weeks and 41 weeks. Physician typically induce labor at 43 weeks so pregnancies rarely go longer than that. Since induced labor occurs at 43 weeks and most babies are born before 41 weeks, it’s safe say that first babies do not arrive late. However, first born children do tend linger in womb longer than ensuing births. On average, subsequent pregnancies are shorter than the first. Which is generally received as positive news, however on average future womb occupations tend to evict their tennants 13 hours sooner than the first time around. "
