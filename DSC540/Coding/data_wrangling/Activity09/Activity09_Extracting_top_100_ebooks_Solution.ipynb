    "Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to \"encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks\". It was founded in 1971 by American writer Michael S. Hart and is the **oldest digital library.** This longest-established ebook project releases books that entered the public domain, and can be freely read or downloaded in various electronic formats.\n",

    "## What is this activity all about?\n",
    "* **This activity aims to scrape the url of the Project Gutenberg's Top 100 ebooks (yesterday's ranking) for identifying the ebook links. **\n",
    "* **It uses BeautifulSoup4 for parsing the HTML and regular expression code for identifying the Top 100 ebook file numbers.**\n",
    "* **You can use those book ID numbers to download the book into your local drive if you want**"
